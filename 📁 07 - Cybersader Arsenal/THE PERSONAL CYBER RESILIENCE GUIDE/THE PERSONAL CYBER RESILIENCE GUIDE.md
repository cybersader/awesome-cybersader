TOTAL WORK IN PROGRESS HERE - just jotted down randomness for now

> [!tldr] A principled and pragmatic guide to operating resiliently in cyberspace

> [!info] This is my opionated tech stack or cyber arsenal which can be leveraged by the average person or the seasoned cyber practitioner. Once there is a contribution workflow, then I will open this up for contributions.

# DROPZONE - NEW IDEAS HERE

- [Operation Privacy](https://www.operationprivacy.com/) 

# Privacy & Security Workflow Examples

- Axis: budget, technical skill (+time)

# Machines, Hardware

- Use the system that demands your attention least
- Buy from a place like microcenter
- Learn to build a PC and fix them.  Saves you money in the long run

# OS

- Use Linux where you can
- Use Android for mobile if possible - can mimic the UI of iOS
- MAC and Windows are probably your daily drivers for personal computing

# Software

- Learn to use open source software where you can except when something needs managed or to essentially run on a computer somewhere else
- Minimize the amount of applications you install
- Don't use Adobe - Use Affinity

# Cloud Backups

- Have one of your tech friends set up a NAS at home and back up there
- Backup to something like Storj, AWS, etc.

# Messaging

- Get on a platform like Signal that's more private
- Avoid SMS where you can.  It's outdated.
- E2EE messengers
	- Signal
	- Session
	- Simplex
	- Threema
	- 

# Knowledge Management

- Use a combination of Notion, Obsidian, and a versioned storage repository as a SSOT
- I really don't trust Notion - so use Obsidian instead please 

# Mobile Security

- Use a biometric login and backup with something else that's more secure and stored in password manager

# Groceries

- Get an app for groceries
- Minimize your data and what not by configuring the app towards privacy
- Save all your groceries in there and both spouses should download it - helps reduce friction with handling groceries together

# Local Backups

- Duplicati to a NAS with your PC folders and stuff
- Just make sure to back your stuff up

# Personal Backups

# Media

- Subscriptions aren't bad - means you know, depending on some research/investigation and reading their policies, what you are actually supporting

# Politics 

- Our voting system causes a devolvement into bipartisan groups - [(2) Why Democracy Is Mathematically Impossible - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7ws2DF-zk) 
	- [STAR Voting](https://www.starvoting.org/)

	- "best social choice theory voting system"?
- Stand on business/principles
- Simple...strive for truth, but be pedagogical and patient - don't straw man but instead steel man

>"For when one says, 'I follow Paul,' and another, 'I follow Apollos,' are you not mere human beings? What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe‚Äîas the Lord has assigned to each his task. I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow."

# Identity - Authentication and Authorization

- Be careful of where you put your identity
- With your identity, entities can utilize the information to their own ends - a result partly possible because of modern computing
- Use aliasing for the types of identity verification that these entities requires.  This is especially true for those entities which have interests not aligned to your own
	- Modern examples of this:
		- Email aliasing
			- [Support plus addressing in email routing - Feedback / Feature Request Submitting & Feedback - Cloudflare Community](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/support-plus-addressing-in-email-routing/346812)
			- [Gmail Plus Addressing: The Hidden Feature that Can Help You Get More Out of Your Inbox | NC State Extension](https://eit.ces.ncsu.edu/2023/02/gmail-plus-addressing-the-hidden-feature-that-can-help-you-get-more-out-of-your-inbox/)
			- [What are the security reasons for disallowing the plus sign in email addresses? - Information Security Stack Exchange](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/65244/what-are-the-security-reasons-for-disallowing-the-plus-sign-in-email-addresses)
			- 
		- Plus ("+") Addressing (not guaranteed to hide identity) - not all email providers implement it and some do "." addressing
- Data minimization
	- Minimizing data in forms
	- Configuring settings to minimize data usage for the entity's interest - especially true in countries where laws make this easier (EU with GDPR)
- Authentication factor management
	- Be smart about how you handle passwords and usernames
	- Use Bitwarden or KeypassXC
- Implement MFA in places where you would rather not have hackers accessing
	- Put 2FA on your password manager - if you're putting all your eggs in a basket then you might as well fortify it.  2FA will defend against anything except a really advanced hacker 
- Put added security on factors of auth 
	- Add extra security to your mobile carrier or SIM card - speak with mobile carrier 

# Media 

- Use "unbiased" sources? - yeah...that's a dilemma.  Just seek out the truth honestly and try to see things from other perspectives the best you can.  It's no productive to go fight some ghosts.
- Avoid "free" websites or minimize data and maximize privacy on them to demotivate unethical/immoral means to monetization
- Use [Sub-Based & Ad-Avoiding Media Platforms](../../üï∏Ô∏è%20UNSTRUCTURED/Sub-Based%20&%20Ad-Avoiding%20Media%20Platforms.md)

# VPNs

- The only way this helps with privacy at all is with the correlation of your public IP address, but it's surely not worth the risk and giving that data to VPN providers
- Don't use a VPN unless you're on the road on wifi (such as in a hotel) or need to get around a geo-block
	- ProtonVPN
	- Mullvad
- Volunteer trusted VPNs that are slow
	- Calyx
	- Riseup
- Tor relays are good but for only the technical people
- Proton VPN has a good free plan
- Orbot - repurposed VPN slot on mobile devices to help use Tor system-wide 
- Windscribe VPN (not sure about the trust here) - limited on bandwidth
- IVPN - good too but more expensive than others like Mullvad - not sure I trust this one either though
- Mullvad is open source and trusted - 5 per month 
- Apple private relay - 1 dollar a month - VPN in Safari only - only for people who use Safari and need to access sites or travel a lot or want it when they do
