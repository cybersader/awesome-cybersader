I'm finally adding another drive to my home server.

# VDEVs & Disks Explained

- VDEVs have drives in them
- They are the logical components to a pool
- You apply RAID to a VDEV

# Adding a Drive to Current Pool, Upgrading to RAID 1 (Two Drives)

- Just to be clear, I'm not rich and therefore I had to slowly buy drives.  I started with 1 drive - hence RAID 0.  Now I have 2 drives which is why I'm moving to a mirrored setup for basic redundancy.

- Some people seem to think it's simple to upgrade from RAID 0 (1 drive without redundancy) to RAID 1 (mirrored mode)
	- [Just delete the pool and recrate a new pool with RAID level you want. Export disconnect/delete....](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/how-to-upgrade-the-raid.115473/)
- Can it be easier though?

- It looks like the solution to this is called "extending" the pool

# Expanding an Existing Pool

- TL;DR - you can't just add one drive to the pool...well actually you kind of can?

- ZFS uses Data VDEVs
	- ![400](_attachments/TrueNAS%20Scale%20RAID%20Setup/IMG-20240811164735822.png)
- VDEVs don't need same size
	- ![400](_attachments/TrueNAS%20Scale%20RAID%20Setup/IMG-20240811164735890.png)
- VDEV does not need to be symmetrical size or drive count
	- ![400](_attachments/TrueNAS%20Scale%20RAID%20Setup/IMG-20240811164735974.png)
- Mirrors
	- You can use this but it's expensive for storage
	- ![400](_attachments/TrueNAS%20Scale%20RAID%20Setup/IMG-20240811164736072.png)
- You can have many pools
	- Datasets are not shared between pools
