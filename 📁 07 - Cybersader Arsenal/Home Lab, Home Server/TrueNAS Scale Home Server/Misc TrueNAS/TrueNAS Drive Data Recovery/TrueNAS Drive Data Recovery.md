	- "Your best bet is going to be to put FreeNAS onto another USB drive, not touch the data disks until you can do that and boot a computer into FreeNAS with it to pull the data off."
	- "Well I'm sorry to tell you but you should have never popped those drives into a Windows machine, you may have done something to the file system to harm it, but I'm not saying things were not bad from the beginning of your plight. There are no recovery tools for ZFS, not really."
	- "You don't have to import the hard drives. It should be as simple as auto-importing the pool per our manual. Of course, if you didn't use a zpool then that would explain your problems with importing."
