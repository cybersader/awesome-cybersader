
I've been trying to gain control over my data for years.  These are some tools that you can use as you see fit.  Comment other methods or tools below that I've missed.

In the personal realm of data privacy, the risks typically relate to wasting your time, attention, search results, or even screen space on things that don't help you. The internet was made to help us solve problems and communicate betterâ€”and for many, it could be better. Maybe it's that your inbox is becoming cluttered, you get tons of spam calls, or maybe you are addicted to your phone. No matter what your goals are with technology, everybody wants to have control of their data. Yet, we have to take control in a way that doesn't waste our time. Nobody wants to go spend 4 hours on a Saturday doing this.

# The Two Places to Attack with Personal Data Privacy

Often, there are 2 components that you can tie to personal data privacy...

## 1. Identity - figuring out who you are

**Who you are**

- You can figure out a person's identity from the obvious singular pieces of info like SSN, name, phone number, or ID numbers.  
- However, you can also find it from combinations of less obvious information:
	- Screen size of your phone as you surf the web
	- Internet address of the device - depends on how you're accessing the internet
	- Type of browser being used
	- Reused email address
	- Cookies

If you can mask or mess with some of these components, then it can give you more control and make it harder for information about you to be gathered and curated at a larger scale.

## 2. Activity & Interests - figuring out what you do

**What you do, What you are interested in**

- Entities (e.g. companies, government) will tie your identity to the things you do, places you go, your interests, your goals, your motives, your relationships, and your search results.

This doesn't necessarily mean changing what you do.  Sure, you could stop using Google Maps to hide where you go from advertisers, but driving around without convenient GPS would be tough.  What this *can* mean is changing what activities they are allowed to see.  These are things like saying no to the web cookies, turning on privacy-respecting settings, and requesting that your data be deleted.  Many times, we already have control of our data, but that control is not turned on by default.

# Personal Data Privacy - Tech, Tools, and Tips

From practical to paranoid...

## 1) Essentials

1. Use a password manager
	- This is step one because it makes security and privacy way more convenient.  Please do this at the very least.
	- I don't recommend using the "password manager" in your browser.  
	- The ones I would recommend:
		- Bitwarden
		- ProtonPass
		- 1Password
	- Other password managers are good too, but some of the others have not had good track records - data breaches, bad performance, and user friction.  As always, do your own research here if you find that one that I mentioned didn't work for you
	- If you choose to use Bitwarden:
		- Set up an "organization" in the app so you and your family can have shared passwords
		- Use a biometric login so you usually never have to type the password
		- Secure new logins with two-factor authentication - https://bitwarden.com/help/setup-two-step-login/.  Turned on by default in 2025.
		- Use the password generator when you make new passwords
		- Use the username generator to automatically create email aliases for new logins - https://bitwarden.com/help/generator/#username-types
2. Use email aliasing or "plus addressing"
	- Adding a plus address to you current emails is a good start here.  However, the bigger companies can still track you through these by simply taking what's after the "+" sign (the alias part) out.
	- Adding a plus address like (name+alias@email.com) with current email providers
		- iCloud email aliasing - https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/icloud/mm6b1a490a/icloud
		- Gmail email aliasing - https://support.google.com/mail/thread/227751799/how-google-email-alias-works-individual-account-not-google-workspace?hl=en
		- Outlook email aliasing - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/plus-addressing-in-exchange-online
		- Proton mail email aliasing - https://proton.me/support/addresses-and-aliases#plus
	- Full email alias solutions
		- These can also integrate with some password managers to automatically create a new alias email when you create a new login.
		- Examples
			- SimpleLogin
			- Addy / Anonaddy
			- Firefox Relay
			- DuckDuckGo aliasing
3. Change privacy settings on important apps
	- Start with the apps you use the most or which likely gather the most personal data
	- Definitely check privacy settings for:
		- Social media apps
		- Email
		- Search engine
		- Browser
4. Use a privacy-respecting browser (or change the privacy settings)
	- If you don't want to switch browsers ever then change the privacy settings of your current one.
	- Examples
		- Phone and Desktop
			- Firefox
			- Brave
			- Safari (they had an ad recently about privacy - research this)
		- Desktop Only
			- Zen
			- Arc
5. When you're suspicious, read the website/app's privacy policy
	- Use this awesome website to get a quick breakdown of the privacy policy or terms of service - https://tosdr.org/en
	- https://proton.me/blog/how-to-read-privacy-policy#what-to-look-for-in-a-privacy-policy

## 2) Intermediate

1. Make your search engine more private
	- Go into the privacy settings of your current browser and change them
	- Examples of privacy-focused search engines (do your own research)
		- Brave Search
		- DuckDuckGo
		- SearX
		- Startpage
2. Turn on DNS-over-HTTPS in your browser apps
	- With Chrome, the setting is called "Secure DNS"
	- If you use a different browser, then figure out how to turn on "DNS-over-HTTPS"
	- This helps keep the websites you go to secure from prying eyes
3. Change the privacy settings on your phone (Android, iPhone)
	- Simply, explore your phone's privacy settings
	- Android guide example - https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-get-to-know-android-privacy-and-security-settings#level-1-everyday-essentials
	- iPhone guide example - https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-get-to-know-iphone-privacy-and-security-settings#level-1-everyday-essentials
4. Use virtual payment with privacy settings on
	- If you want to use Apple Pay, Google Pay, Google Wallet, then make sure to go into the privacy settings.  Privacy settings often won't be on by default
	- Other examples (do your own research):
		- Privacy.com
		- Paypal
5. Use spam blocking services
	- https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/stop-unwanted-robocalls-and-texts
	- https://www.fcc.gov/call-blocking -  tons of apps mentioned by the FCC
	- Nomorobo - call blocking on mobile or VOIP
6. (Usually...) Don't use a VPN
	- There are only 3 reasons you should be using a VPN:
		- 1) A corporate VPN to do your work
		- 2) A personal VPN to access "geo-blocked" media like sports
		- 3) A personal VPN because you travel a lot and get onto sketchy coffee shop or hotel Wi-Fi a lot.
	- If this is you, then go with a *trusted* and actually private VPN.  Most VPNs aren't.
	- Do your research and find what you trust.  Many VPN companies have been found to share their data with marketing and advertising agencies (especially the ones you see countless ads from).  Again, do your research.
	- Content explaining VPNs:
		- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-vpn
		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_b8Z2kAFyY
	- Examples of VPNs (do your own research)
		- Mullvad VPN
		- Proton VPN
		- IVPN
		- (ADVANCED) Build your own VPN with a cloud service provider
7. Use an Encrypted Messaging App
	- Unencrypted text is a part of mass surveillance and presents security dilemmas.
	- Chinese threat actor "Salt Typhoon" recently hacked 9 of our major telecommunication companies (ATT and Verizon admitted they're on the list).  Both Google and Apple have not implemented cross-platform encrypted texting.
	- Popular apps (ranked from most to least secure)
		- Signal (encrypted everywhere by default)
		- Facebook Messenger (encrypted in 1-on-1s)
		- iMessage (not encrypted to non-iOS)
		- Google Messages (not encrypted to non-Android)
8. Use a different email provider
	- Proton Mail
	- Tuta Mail
9. Check your information against breaches and cybersecurity incidents
	- Check where your email has been involved in a breach
		- HaveIbeenPwned
		- Dehashed
10. Clean up data online (do your own research)
	- Personal Data Exposure
		- https://inteltechniques.com/workbook.html
		- Username search
			- https://whatsmyname.app/
		- Face Search Engine
			- https://pimeyes.com/en
		- Other tools
			- https://osintframework.com/ - tons of tools you could explore here
			- Look for your information - https://molfar.com/en/blog/how-to-find-information-on-anyone-the-best-osint-tools-for-people-search
	- Data removal
		- Due to laws, most websites will let you remove your data
		- https://inteltechniques.com/workbook.html
		- https://www.thesecuredad.com/post/review-deleteme-worththemoney
		- https://backgroundchecks.org/justdeleteme/
		- DeleteMe - automated removal of personal data from data brokers

## 3) Advanced / Power-User

1. Set up personal storage at home for streaming media, storing photos, etc.
	- Only do this if you have a techy person in your family.  They aren't always simple to set up.
	- Get a home NAS (network attached storage) device
	- NAS examples:
		- Synology
		- Asustor
		- HexOS
		- TrueNAS Scale (IT pros)
	- Google alternatives:
		- Nextcloud - Google Drive alternative
		- Immich - Google Photos alternative
	- Netflix alternatives:
		- Plex
		- Jellyfin
2. Change DNS (domain name system) providers
	- This requires messing with your router a little bit.  This is only for the techies and power users.
	- Examples:
		- Mullvad DNS
		- Control D
		- NextDNS
		- (if you're techy) Set up your own DNS at home (e.g. OpenDNS)
1. Use offline alternatives for popular online apps
	- Instead of Office 365, maybe try LibreOffice
	- Instead of Adobe photoshop, try Affinity
	- Instead of online notetaking apps like Notion, try Obsidian, Logseq, Standard Notes, etc.
2. Use a temporary phone number for some accounts
	- You could try using Google Voice
	- Examples:
		- https://voip.ms/
		- https://hushed.com/

## 4) Paranoid

1. (PARANOID) Title all your larger assets to a Trust or LLC
	- You could do this and mileage may vary on how it affects your mail or marketing based on your home address
2. (PARANOID) Go read the book on Extreme Privacy

The Two Places to Attack with Personal Data Privacy

Often, there are 2 components that you can tie to personal data privacy...

Cookies

If you can mask or mess with some of these components, then it can give you more control and make it harder for information about you to be gathered and curated at a larger scale.

1. Activities & Interests

What do you do when you're using the internet?

Entities (e.g. companies, government) will tie your identity to the things you do, places you go, your interests, your goals, your motives, your relationships, and your search results.

Short Version: 3 Steps You Can Take Today

I have a huge list of things you can do in this article.  However, if you need a simple place to start, here you go.

Download a password manager on your phoneThis can fast-track you on other good privacy and security practices like the ones I mention later here

These are my 3 favorite picksBitwarden

ProtonPass

1Password

Change the privacy settings on your most-used app (1 app)Choose an app to look at:Browser - Chrome, Safari(or download a privacy respecting browser)

Social media - Meta (Instagram, Facebook), YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, Pinterest

Google or Apple accounts - Any privacy settings on these (including map apps)

Search Engine - also usually Google(or start using a privacy-respecting search engine)

Audit your phone's privacy settingsGo through your phone's security and privacy settings
