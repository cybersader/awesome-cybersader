# How to Accelerate Finding and Professionally Developing Talented InfoSec Team Members | Kip Boyle
## Work on program, not in it
- Work on your program instead of in it #quotesCISO #quotesCyber
	- Your program and team need to have a multiplicative nature rather than additive.  They need to multiply the value of each other
- Focus on tasks only you can do - core competencies
	- Strategic goals, framework, and how your team will grow
	- Don't be in the trenches
- Delegate, delegate, delegate
	- Don't be a control freak
- CHMH - [Cybersecurity Hiring Manager Handbook: Cybersecurity Hiring Manager Handbook](https://cybersecurity-hiring-manager-handbook.netlify.app/) 
	- Contributable resource for hiring cyber talent
## The Goal
- Focus on strategic goals, framework, and how your team will grow rather than being in the trenches
## Delegation Technique and Tool
- Very effective and efficient
- Get important, recurring work off your plate
- Provides professional development 
- [Fierce Conversations: Achieving Success at Work and in Life One Conversation at a Time: Scott, Susan: 8601400277058: Amazon.com: Books](https://www.amazon.com/Fierce-Conversations-Achieving-Success-Conversation/dp/0425193373) - book about how to delegate

- Will get the recurring work off your plate
	- Need to be able to document and SOP the stuff if you can

- Gradually let go of tasks till you know delegate can do it well

- Retention Ideal #4:
	- Aggresively create learning and growth opportunities for your people by sending them to training, giving them a learning stipend, and sharing your network with them.

- View delegated tasks as decisions
	- Example of a decision:
		- Policy is required, but there's an exception approval process. MFA that you require for remote access, some people show up to ask for the exception. If this happens a lot this is something you can delegate.  
		- You're delegating the decision of "should this be approved or denied"

### Delegation Tree
- Tree to delegate decisions (I do - we do - you do????)
	- Start at bottom with the roots (sub-problems or sub-decisions)
		- Guide them along
		- Give them training and criteria for process
		- Have delegate give the recommendation or solution and the why, but I'll make the decision
	- Trunk
		- You make the decision, but before you tell people tell me so I can give a quick look
	- Branch
		- You're doing great
		- Make the decisions/solutions and be autonomous
		- Explain the decisions/solutions
		- Give me a report (daily, weekly, monthly, etc)
	- Leaf
		- Make the decision/solution, act on it, don't talk to me
		- If there's a major exception, then you can escalate to me

### When to Delegate
- Opportunity to grow and develop team members
- Task will recur in a similar form in the future
- You have enough time to delegate the job effectively
- Someone ready for skills, access, and responsibility
### Tool
- Top half is boilerplate
- Share with delegates.  Use company system, wiki, daily or weekly checkups, and project tracking to keep up.

## Process for I do, we do, you do
- I do. You watch. We talk. (OBS)
- You do. I watch. We talk. (Screen share, Zoom)
- You do. We talk (1:1 meetings)
- You do
## Common Delegation Errors
- They might not be ready
- Your task training may be confusing, abstract, or incomplete
	- be careful with delegating abstract tasks that have 20 new acronyms #cyberMeme 
- Moving to leaf too quickly
- Don't always start at the root
	- If they know enough, it can be demotivating for them
- Back off and don't micromanage
## Micromanagement?
- It's just on-the-job training
	- We are trying to set them up for success and save resources
## Delegation Practice

## HR Partner Exercise
- You need to hire new member for cyber/SOC/InfoRisk team
- What are your largest blockers related to your HR department
	- A GROC (gross rent occupancy cost) lobster? #cyberMeme 
	- low budget
	- they are being too literal with description
- How to remove blockers
	- Take HR out to lunch...actually
- What does a supportive HR partner look like?
	- Taking our objectives and helping us look at local talent pool related to those problems
		- Understands needs and servant attitude
	- Final say on job description
	- Understand and support your approach but don't provide much material support - they get out of your way (acceptable)
	- Handle some minor things and stay out of my way (can be acceptable)
- Two types of HR departments
	- strategic mode and transactional mode
	- transactional HR mode
		- most people know this one
		- get butts in seats for low cost
		- focus too much on hard skills and pedigrees
	- strategic HR mode
		- really see people as company's assets
		- look for people with great soft skills that can't be trained on the job
## Our Role in Hiring
- Do you treat hiring with importance?
- We need to give our HR relationship time and attention
- This allows us to delegate and execute
	- Work on and not in your program
- Go to events and meet people to gauge things yourself
## First Talk with HR
- Need your help - review hiring criteria for open position
- Use Common Cybersecurity Org Chart and Service Catalog - HR-Security Toolkit

- Explain areas you tend to hire in the most - lots of turnover?
- Tell them the criteria for job trying to fill - look for and make adjustments
	- Most likely be less restrictive - ask for exceptions to hiring policy if need be
## Why HR Support For Security Can Be Difficult
- HR department was a well oiled machine for certain positions and not others
	- They look at
