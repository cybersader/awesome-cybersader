# Common Problems I've Fixed

I've experienced 4 things to check in the toilet tank to make sure flushing works:
1) Make sure there isn't a lot of slack in the chain.  If there is, then move the hook that attaches to the "arm" to a different chain link till there isn't much slack
2) The flapper can be improved or adjusted.  I've found that there may be an adjustable float or a dial that uses air holes - both affecting the speed at which the flapper closes during flushing
3) Check the "arm" that's attached to the handle and chain and make sure it's not rusted.  Turns out this was why my toilet was getting worse and worse with more flushes.  If it's rusted, then get a new one.  The adjustable ones for angle are great because it doesn't matter then where the handle is on the toilet.  I bought one for 10 bucks.
4) The fill valve may need to be replaced if there's a constant noise with the toilet.  Sometimes you'll just need to replace a part of the fill valve
