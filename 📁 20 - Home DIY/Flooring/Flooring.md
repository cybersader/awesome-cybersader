- Use LVP (luxury vinyl planks)
	- Best bang for your buck
	- Waterproof usually
- You'll need an extending Mitre saw and a table saw for ease of cutting
- Make sure your spacers are in - it's not fun trying to move a whole row of floor when it's lodged itself under the drywall into the stud
- For the table saw, use the bar for cutting long ways and the other attachment for short ways
- You can use a hand saw instead with clamps on a table as well
- Get knee pads or something to do it comfortably
- Don't try to be "cute" or "optimized" with it - [Cutting Stock Problem](../üï∏Ô∏è%20UNSTRUCTURED/Cutting%20Stock%20Problem.md)
- Learn the process:
	- start from one side of the room
	- go the distance of the row, then save the end cut as a start for the next row
	- hammer in incrementally to get rid of gaps
	- use an oscillating saw to fit into weird corners and turns
	- for places where you have to backtrack into a recessed part of the room, like a closet, just be ready to hammer in a lot of directions to get things right
- Keep a gap from the wall with little plastic spacers for flooring
