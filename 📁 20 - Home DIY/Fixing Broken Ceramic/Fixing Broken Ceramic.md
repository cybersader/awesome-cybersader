# Broken Coffee Mugs - High Temp Liquid Use

- [What glue to use for broken mug handle? : r/fixit](https://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/laxa4x/what_glue_to_use_for_broken_mug_handle/)
	- For clean breaks
		- CA (cyanoacrylate, aka Super Glue). As long as it's a clean break it holds like crazy.
		- "Eh, I always use superglue (specifically the Gorilla brand) on ceramics."
		- gorilla makes a clear super glue that works really well.
		- 
	- Misc
		- "I just want to state that after gluing this mug will require hand washing. The moisture (and drying cycles) will weaken the bond over time. This is true for pretty much any adhesive you might find at the hardware store."

	- Epoxy resin, Cyanoacrylate (superglue)
	- If you have a bright enough UV lamp you can use UV-curing acrylic resins on (white) ceramics. They are intended for glass and need more UV exposure because the ceramic blocks a lot.
	- Just use any old glue you can find but add heat shrink tubing over the break(s), post a pic of the result. That will add much to your street cred here. 
	- Superglue does not survive the dishwasher. Have not tried the UV cure superglue, but it probably will also not survive heat. 2 part white epoxy does do quite well, but also fails. the silicone probably will last the longest
	- Repaired ceramic always looks crap. Perhaps you can enhance the repair by emphasising it with some JB Weld and embedded SMD stuff.
	- Epoxies usually seem to survive best, but polyureathane seems to be the new high performer (eg gorilla glue).
	- I have a ceramic bowl that was repaired with CA, and it's held up for several years worth of dishwashing.  I think as long as the area of the glue line that is exposed to the outside is small it should hold up quite well.  Likewise we have a ceramic spoon holder that has a much more substantial repair that's held up for a while, but that only goes in the dishwasher fairly rarely.  It helps to use a higher-quality CA, either from a good hobby store or an industrial supplier, and perhaps a thinner viscosity type to keep the joint thin. There's a wide range of UV-cure adhesives, so it's not really possible to say categorically how well they would do.  The big problem is getting the UV into the joint to fully cure it.  A good solution could be something like Norland 83H, which can be surface-cured with UV to temporarily secure the joint and then fully cured via heat.  Once cured, it's rated for operation from -150 to +150C.  It's not cheap, though.
	- The normal recommendation would be a high temperature epoxy, but the normal clear epoxy you can find in a hardware store is limited in its resistance to dishwasher temperatures. I purchased some marine epoxy specifically to repair a broken mug handle recently, but I have delayed trying it because it is white and I would prefer a clear glue. The marine epoxy claims to handle high temperatures and moisture much better than other epoxies I have looked at.
	- I use "Crazy Glue" available at Walmart.  I have a few coffee mug with glued repair.  They survived the dish washer just fine for over 3 years so far and they are currently in use.  My plastic pitcher currently in use is also Crazy-Glue repaired.  Make sure you get the "original formula" Crazy Glue Instant dry all purpose.  They branched out their brand.  Some of them like the one for "Craft" (you see that word on the packaging just before/after the word "Crazy Glue), the Pen kind...  Those other specialized crazy glue works like a very bad imitation of the original.
