- Put tape over the back where the holes are and mark with a pen, hole, or marker.  Then, put on the wall and use screws with a small enough pan type head and whatever will fit into the holes on the back of the power strip.  You can use box nails also but they can slide in and out of drywall.  Trim screws could work or probably sheet metal screws even.
- Pan head screws that are small are probably best bet for screws
- Alternatively, use 3M strips or mounting tape
