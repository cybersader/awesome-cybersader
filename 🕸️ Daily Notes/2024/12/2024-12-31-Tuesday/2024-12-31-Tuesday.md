# Networking Troubles with Xbox

- I get that multiplayer games are hard, but I didn't know there was so much going on in the background

# I went 1000s of LBs over on a truckload

#home/diy

- I had to fill a 9ft by 9ft square with gravel that's 4 inches deep
- This equates to 27 cubic feet which, turns out, weighs anywhere from 2,500 - 4000 pounds (depending on moisture content)!
- Most trucks don't reach that upper end and it was a rainy the day before
- It worked, but definitely don't recommend going a long distance or there can be some risks
- The landscaping place was way cheaper than home depot though ($60 instead of ~$350 (if we went with a home improvement store)

# We almost caught a cat hiding in Home Depot

- We found black kittens at Home Depot and decided to try catching one.  Turns out, this is really hard to humanely do without a trap box or a kennel.  So, we got a kennel from the pet store.  We will probably try again since they're still probably there.

# We ate our frozen wedding cake 1 year later

- Not sure I recommend this, but it sure is a fun way to do an anniversary
