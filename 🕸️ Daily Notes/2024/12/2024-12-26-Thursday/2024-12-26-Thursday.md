# A Christmas Prayer for Meals

This is a little prayer I wrote up before we ate on Christmas:

```
Father in heaven.

We thank you for the gift of your son Jesus.
Whose birth we celebrate today
Not everyone here may share a belief in you,
Nonetheless, bring us together in gratitude and help us to contemplate these joys of life.
Your son Christ is true food for our souls.
Here today, bless us with this food and bring us closer in relationship with you.
In your name we pray.

Amen
```

# Backflips are a great for abs

- I did two backflips yesterday for Christmas
- I'm surprised to find that my abs are sore today from two of them
- The initial stretch and explosive pull seem to cause hypertrophy and in turn help grow abs
- As I get older, I hope to keep doing backflips even if that means transitioning solely to trampoline or diving boards (due to the impact on joints)
