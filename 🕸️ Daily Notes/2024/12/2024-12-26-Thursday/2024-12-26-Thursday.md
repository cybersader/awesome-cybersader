# A Christmas Prayer for Meals

This is a little prayer I wrote up before we ate on Christmas:

```
Father in heaven.

We thank you for the gift of your son Jesus.
Whose birth we celebrate today
Not everyone here may share a belief in you,
Nonetheless, bring us together in gratitude and help us to contemplate these joys of life.
Your son Christ of Christmas is food to our souls.
Here today, bless us with this food and bring us closer in relationship with you.
In your name we pray.

Amen
```
