Lots of movies and tv shows these days seem to be pushing some utilitarian and vengeful tones that are troubling.  They tend to say science is essentially the foundation of all reality, or that the ends always justify the means.  It's always begging a philosophical question or yearning for some more fundamental realities.  I don't get it.  It's so foolish, but people like novelty I guess.  Thing is, kids movies usually make more sense or at least have some coherence in the lesson or message.
