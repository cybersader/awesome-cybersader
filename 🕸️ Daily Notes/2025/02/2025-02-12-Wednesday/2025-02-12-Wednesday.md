I've loved using AI to help me code quicker on low-risk projects, but sometimes it does hallucinate in ways that I wouldn't expect.  

I built a new collection of python functions to help process incredibly large CSVs.  You don't want to fill up your RAM and crash your computer, so you essentially have to take a "chunked" approach to doing stuff with your tabular (Excel or CSV) type data.

This was an extension of my older Jsonaut project which can selectively flatten humongous JSON file.
