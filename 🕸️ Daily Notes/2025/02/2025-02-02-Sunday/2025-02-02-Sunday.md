# The Prodigal Son

- Who are we in the parable of the prodigal son?
- Sometimes we are...
	- The elder son 
		- Don't see others as deserving of the Lord's mercy
		- Don't ask the Lord for more grace in our lives even though we've been adopted to those blessings
	- The prodigal son
		- Feel undeserving and shameful
	- The other children
		- Living our lives in Christ's suffering and being watchful as to not leave the Father's house and become lost
		- Hoping that our brothers and sisters choose to come home
- If we were lost, what if we didn't make it back like the prodigal son?
- How do think about death or suffering?  How often do we contemplate our own deaths?
- We are only saved by God's grace - not our actions and surely not our "worthiness."  We should strive to always be reconciled with our Father.  
- When we feel ourselves becoming lost, be quick to see it and acknowledge it.  Ask the Father or your obedient brothers and sisters for help and intercession through prayer.
