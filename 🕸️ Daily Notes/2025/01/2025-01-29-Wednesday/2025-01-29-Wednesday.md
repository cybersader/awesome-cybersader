Yeah.  We've hit a point in AI where humanity's brokenness will bring about some suffering I'm sure.  

[Data Privacy Week 2025](../../../../📁%2005%20-%20Organizational%20Cyber/Data%20Privacy%20Week/Data%20Privacy%20Week%202025/Data%20Privacy%20Week%202025.md)

I did a presentation on data privacy which is parallel with the AI race.  DeepSeekR1 became a thing and it's a big deal.  It's no secret that China wants to overtake the U.S. and make us "irrelevant."  However, I don't put my life on circumstance but on the Lord's promise and my identity as an adopted son of God.

All this FUD takes away from those close to us that we are responsible for, and that's what we should truly focus on.

This doesn't mean going out and commenting on YouTube and TikTok videos to feel involved.  Let's join the work of Christ for real and die to ourselves first by loving those we've been entrusted.
