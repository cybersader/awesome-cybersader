# Computer Science and Communism

- I noticed that some of the ideas in computing actually relate to government.  When trying to scale certain systems, you often run into issues where a decentralized or federated architecture would work much better.  In the same way, communism in its more extreme versions (not like New Harmony Indiana or a very small very old utopia) always fails because it doesn't scale well when you have a central place for deciding how to align work with interests.
