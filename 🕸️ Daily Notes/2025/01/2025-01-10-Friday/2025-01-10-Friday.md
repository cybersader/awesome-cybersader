# Carrying Your Cross

- Don't ask for the weight to be lighter or to put it down.  Ask for the faith and strength to carry it.

# "Don't Die"

#fitness 

- There's a content creator on YouTube that I enjoy so far and find valuable - "Bryan Johnson"
- I think a hasty assumption of the content can seem to presume that everyone could reach the "don't die" goal. Obviously, what's really happening here is just the hard work to answer questions to begin towards that goal.
- An interesting thing about prolonging lifespan is that it has some dilemmas in solving that problem.  From a Christian/Catholic perspective, there's nothing inherently wrong with this goal.  It just simply isn't the most important one.
