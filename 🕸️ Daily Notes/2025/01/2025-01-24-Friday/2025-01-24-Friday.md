# GRC Responsibilities and Company Growth

Q:
- I do GR(not C) for a mid-sized credit union. We do a bit of the technical secops. As we grow, it's hard to know which team (IT or risk mgmt) gets the specialized work (e.g. vulns, SIEM). Thoughts?

A:
- 
# OT Security

- The technology is less fault tolerant generally.  Any issues or downtime are a hundred-fold worse in that context generally.  The ramifications tend to be scary.
