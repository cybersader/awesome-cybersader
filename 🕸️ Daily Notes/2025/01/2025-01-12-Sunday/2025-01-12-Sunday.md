# Saving a Cat from the Outdoor Sections of Home Depot

- Yesterday, we saved a cat from a home depot.  The cat is probably about 4 months old
- It hisses at first but it totally loves pets.  I think it just got used to hissing at people walking by in the outdoor section of home depot
- I'm now learning how to take care of a cat myself
- Not sure what to name her yet
- My grandmother's funeral was on the same day and she was known for her love of animals and I grew up going to the humane society with her.  What a blessing.
