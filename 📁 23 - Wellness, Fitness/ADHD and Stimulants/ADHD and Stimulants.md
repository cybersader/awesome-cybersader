- [Adderall, Stimulants & Modafinil for ADHD: Short- & Long-Term Effects | Huberman Lab • Podcast Notes](https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/adderall-stimulants-modafinil-for-adhd-short-long-term-effects-huberman-lab/) 
# Attention, Prefrontal Cortex & ADHD
- Attention involves cognitive operations such as suppression of noise and focusing on relevant information
- Prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in orchestrating neural activity for attention
	- Prefrontal cortex has top-down inhibition, suppressing other brain areas and enhancing salience
	- Your ability to sit still is the prefrontal cortex sending inhibitory signals to other parts of the brain
	- Impulse control affected by prefrontal cortex
	- Prefrontal is the "shhhhhhh" to other parts of brain
	- Salience is attention to other signals
	- Prefrontal can "point" to parts of brain to "speak up"
	- Prefrontal cortex has executive function to quiet some and enhance salience of other circuits
	- We know that ADHD is the diminishing ability to communicate with other parts of the brain
- Default mode network
	- Imagination, spooling together of experiences, and not focused on external things
	- When we attend to external things that we need attention to, the default mode network activity is suppressed
- In ADHD, default mode network is active even when we are attending to other things
- Networks
	- Dorsal attention network
	- Salience networks
- ADHD != bad prefrontal cortex, but instead prefrontal to other areas
- Prefrontal cortex control is affected by ADHD medication that improve prefrontal cortex functioning
- Drug usage:
	- Can improve brain function long term by teaching the prefrontal cortex
- Addressing common questions about ADHD drugs:
    - Are they addictive?
    - Can they be used briefly or intermittently?
    - Long-term effects of using them as a child
    - Considerations for putting children on these drugs
- Understanding the biology and potential risks associated with these drugs helps in making informed decisions
- **Drugs used to treat ADHD work by creating conditions that improve prefrontal cortex functioning**
    - The goal is to enhance the prefrontal cortex’s ability to suppress and enhance the activity of various brain networks
    - The use of these drugs during development can teach the prefrontal cortex to become a better conductor

- Understanding the biology and potential risks associated with these drugs helps in making informed decisions
# Stimulants “Sympathomimetics”
- **Amphetamines, speed, and other stimulants can improve symptoms of ADHD**
- Increasing activity in the prefrontal cortex alone doesn’t improve attention, as it needs to be flexible and switch between different tasks
- Drugs used to treat ADHD fall under the category of stimulants or sympathomimetics
    - Sympathomimetics mimics the activation of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, responsible for attention and arousal
- **The autonomic nervous system has two major components: sympathetic (fight or flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest)**
    - The balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic is always present, even in sleep or panic attacks
- ADHD drugs, as sympathomimetics, trigger the release of neurochemicals and activation resembling the sympathetic nervous system
- Methamphetamine is a potent sympathomimetic but not commonly prescribed for ADHD due to its high abuse potential and health risks
    - Adderall and Vyvanse have commonly prescribed ADHD drugs that have similar mechanisms of action to methamphetamine but are less potent
# **Adderall, Dopamine & Norepinephrine**
- Adderall is a combination of amphetamine salts, specifically D-amphetamine and L-amphetamine
    - D-amphetamine is more potent and primarily affects the brain
    - L-amphetamine is less potent and mainly causes peripheral effects like increased heart rate and blood pressure
- The major effects of Adderall and other sympathomimetic stimulants are the increased transmission of dopamine and norepinephrine
- Dopamine and norepinephrine are neuromodulators that can increase or decrease the electrical activity of specific brain circuits
- **Dopamine is involved in motivation, pursuit, and mood, while norepinephrine is involved in attention and focus**
- Dopamine and norepinephrine are released at similar locations in the brain and work together to increase motivation, focus, and alertness. They like to "collaborate."
- Drugs that treat ADHD effectively increase motivation, focus, and alertness by targeting specific locations in the brain
	- They target synapses.  
# Sympathomimetics, Dopamine & Norepinephrine
- Synapses are the communication points between neurons, where neurotransmitters are released
- Neurons have a cell body, an axon, and synaptic terminals that contain neurotransmitters
- Neurotransmitters are packaged into vesicles and released into the synaptic cleft
- Transporters in the presynaptic terminal help recycle neurotransmitters back into the neuron
- **Adderall and other sympathomimetics inhibit the activity of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, allowing more neurotransmitters to remain in the synaptic cleft**
- Adderall also disrupts the vesicle monoamine transporter (VMAT), leading to an increased buildup of dopamine and norepinephrine in the presynaptic terminal
- These mechanisms result in a higher amount of dopamine and norepinephrine being released when an electrical signal travels down the neuron
- Adderall primarily increases dopamine levels, although it also affects norepinephrine
- **The ability of Adderall to significantly increase dopamine levels is what makes it effective for ADHD treatment and attractive for recreational use or enhancing focus and attention**
# **Vyvanse is Timed-Release D-Amp**
- Adderall contains both L-amphetamine and D-amphetamine, with D-amphetamine being present in a larger amount
- Vyvanse is not an extended-release version of Adderall but a separate drug that contains only D-amphetamine
- Vyvanse is classified as a prodrug because it is composed of D-amphetamine attached to the amino acid lysine
- When Vyvanse is ingested, the lysine is gradually cleaved off in the gut and bloodstream, resulting in timed-release D-amphetamine
- Vyvanse was developed to reduce the abuse potential of drugs containing D-amphetamine
- D-amphetamine (dextroamfetamine) has been associated with criminal activity and trafficking in the past
    - **Despite its historical associations, D-amphetamine has proven to be an effective treatment for ADHD**
- Vyvanse’s time-release mechanism slows down the absorption of D-amfetamine, leading to a gradual and prolonged increase in dopamine and norepinephrine
- The effects of Vyvanse can last anywhere from 12 to 18 hours, depending on individual metabolism
- **There is no reliable test to predict an individual’s drug metabolism rate, so finding the right dosage and medication type may require trial and error**
- Some individuals may find that Adderall’s quick time course is too fast or leads to a slump in the afternoon, while others may experience overstimulation with a single dose of Adderall
- Adderall and Vyvanse are two different drugs with distinct pharmacological profiles, despite both containing D-amphetamine
- The time-release aspect of Vyvanse is achieved by attaching lysine to D-amphetamine
# Ritalin, Concerta
- Ritalin is also called Concerta (time-released form)
- Huberman was confused why Ritalin was subscribed for hyperactive children
- Methylphenidate works similarly, but it's different
- Ritalin works by increasing dopamine transmission at synapses and inhibiting the function of the presynaptic dopamine transporter
    - It also disrupts the activity of the noradrenergic transporter, leading to increased norepinephrine at the synapse
- **However, Ritalin is not as potent in inhibiting the noradrenergic transporter compared to Adderall and Vyvanse**
- The main effect of Ritalin is increasing dopamine, with some increase in norepinephrine at synapses
- It's not short-time Adderall 
- Lasts 4-6 hours, but Concerta is even slower release
- Ritalin is not equivalent to short-acting Adderall, as it primarily increases dopamine and norepinephrine to a lesser extent
- The lower affinity of Ritalin for the noradrenergic transporter contributes to its relatively lower increase in norepinephrine
- **Ritalin mainly relies on transporter disruption for its effects**
# Dopamine & “Noise Reduction”; Norepinephrine & “Signal Amplification”
- **The prefrontal cortex plays a key role in coordinating focused attention and task-switching in the brain**
- Increasing dopamine at specific synapses and networks in the brain helps reduce background noise and distractions, both from the external environment and internal thoughts or bodily sensations
- Dopamine facilitates the suppression of signals that would otherwise distract us from focused attention
- Norepinephrine boosts signals
	- Concerta and Ritalin doesn't focus on this amplification
	- Norepinephrine, released mainly from the locus coeruleus in the brain, acts as a signal booster at synapses and enhances the amplitude and frequency of communication between neurons
	- Norepinephrine, when released in the brain networks associated with attention and learning, primarily serves to increase the signal
- Medications like Adderall, Vyvanse, and Ritalin increase both dopamine and norepinephrine, leading to a reduction in noise and an amplification of the desired signals in attention-related brain networks
	- This can be too much IMO
- This increase in signal-to-noise ratio enhances the subjective sense of focus and the ability to concentrate on specific tasks
# ADHD: Focus, Hyperactivity & Impulsivity; Drug Selection & Dose
- **Excessive dopamine levels can lead to euphoria, mania, and psychosis, while excessive norepinephrine levels can cause anxiety and panic attacks**
- **Not everyone with ADHD exhibits impulsivity and hyperactivity; some individuals struggle primarily with focus**
- Children and adults with ADHD can have difficulty entering a focused state, especially for tasks they find uninteresting or challenging
- ADHD is characterized by extreme variations in focus ability, with individuals capable of intense concentration on activities they enjoy
- ADHD involves challenges in focusing on activities necessary for normal life advancement, such as listening to conversations or sitting still
- **Dosing of ADHD medications must be carefully calibrated to ensure optimal levels of dopamine and norepinephrine**
- ADHD is a complex condition with different patterns and variations among individuals
- The diversity in ADHD symptoms and individual responses to medications highlights the importance of consulting with a qualified psychiatrist to find the ideal drug and dosage for each person’s specific pattern of ADHD
# **How to do Stimulants ‘Calm’ ADHD?**
- ADHD symptoms in children and adults are not caused by deficient activity in specific brain circuits but rather by hyperconnectivity between networks
- **ADHD is not simply a dopamine or norepinephrine deficiency; these neuromodulators modulate neural circuit activity**
	- These can increase or decrease neural activities in certain areas
- Medications for ADHD aim to adjust dopamine and norepinephrine levels to achieve a balance and reduce synchronous firing
- Meds tune the amounts
- Stimulants for ADHD don’t calm children down directly but increase overall arousal while activating the prefrontal cortex
- Medications help the prefrontal cortex coordinate neural circuit activity like an orchestra conductor or a teacher in the classroom
- The goal of ADHD medication is to fine-tune dosage, timing, and duration for optimal neural circuit functioning
- Dopamine and norepinephrine enable precise activation of brain networks for improved focus and attention in ADHD
# Neuroplasticity & Neuromodulators
- ADHD medications like Adderall, Vyvanse, and Ritalin leverage the neuroplasticity of the brain
    - Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to change in response to experience
- **Strongly activating specific brain networks and increasing the release of neuromodulators like dopamine and norepinephrine induce neuroplasticity**
- Neuromodulators, such as serotonin and acetylcholine, have different roles in the brain
- Elevated levels of dopamine and norepinephrine promote neuroplasticity at synapses
- Neuromodulators modulate the activity of neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between neurons
- Increased dopamine and norepinephrine strengthen connections and make them more easily activated in the future
# **Kids, ADHD Diagnosis & Treatment; Predispose Addiction?**
- **Prescribing sympathomimetic stimulants for children with ADHD aims to help them focus and promote neuroplasticity in brain networks**
- Neuroplasticity allows synapses involved in focus to strengthen and function more efficiently even after stopping the medication
- Parents and individuals should consider the long-term benefits and potential drawbacks of ADHD medication
- **Treated children with ADHD show better performance in school, focusing ability, and general outcomes compared to untreated children**
- **Untreated ADHD in childhood increases the risk of illicit drug use and addiction later in life**
- Children with ADHD who take prescription stimulant drugs do not develop a craving for them in adulthood
- Early treatment with these medications leads to the normalization of brain circuits over time
- **An accurate diagnosis of ADHD is crucial, and a qualified psychiatrist will evaluate the child and consider both pharmacological and behavioral treatments**
- Treatment for ADHD should involve a comprehensive approach, including behavioral prescriptions, learning tools, nutrition, and supplementation
- **Treatment plans should be updated as the child progresses through different stages of development**
# ADHD Medications: Individuality, Doses, Tapering & Long-Term Use
- Whether a child needs to continue ADHD medication indefinitely depends on individual circumstances
- ADHD medication aims to improve neural circuits for focus and increase their strength
- Some individuals may no longer need medication if their circuits have developed sufficiently
- **Tapering off medication should be done under the guidance of a psychiatrist to minimize withdrawal effects**
- Dosage reduction over time is often optimal and should be discussed with a psychiatrist
- Studies show a broad range of drug doses for Adderall, Ritalin, and Vyvanse
- Vyvanse dosages tend to be higher due to the slow-release mechanism
- Predicting individual reactions to dosage is challenging, and it varies greatly among patients
    - A patient’s weight, genetics, and enzyme levels can influence their response to medication
- Individualized dosage should be based on symptom relief and side-effect considerations
- **There is no simple test to predict individual response to ADHD medication**
    - Starting with the lowest effective dose and adjusting as necessary is a logical and safe approach
# Medication & Long-Term Effects: Height, Cardiovascular Risk, Alcohol
- **Long-term use of ADHD medication does not appear to negatively impact height or overall development**
- Children with ADHD who are treated with medication may have slightly higher body mass indexes (BMI) compared to their peers
- Treatment with appropriate dosages does not stunt development or impair growth
- **Prolonged sympathetic nervous system activity carries some cardiovascular risk**
    - One major study suggested a subtle increase in cardiovascular risk with ADHD medication but did not warrant discontinuation of the drugs
- It is important to find the minimal effective dosage for ADHD medication
- Individuals taking ADHD medication should engage in healthy lifestyle practices to support cardiovascular health, such as avoiding smoking, regular exercise, etc
    - **Alcohol consumption, even in moderation, is best avoided when taking ADHD medication**
    - Combining alcohol with ADHD medication can have detrimental effects on the brain and body
- Benzodiazepines and similar drugs should be avoided unless prescribed by a physician
- Always consult a physician for personalized advice regarding ADHD medication and potential interactions
# Cortisol & Hormones
- Few studies have examined the long-term effects of drugs like Adderall, Ritalin, and Vivance on the hormone systems of the body
- **Chronic elevation of the sympathetic nervous system, caused by these drugs, can increase cortisol levels, which is a stress hormone**
- Cortisol has positive roles in the body, including enhancing focus, activating the immune system, and setting the mood
- The timing of cortisol release is crucial, with higher levels in the early part of the day and tapering off towards the end
    - Late-day elevations in cortisol are associated with depressive symptoms
- These drugs can disrupt the endocrine system by affecting other hormones such as thyroid hormone, testosterone, and estrogen
- Chronically elevated cortisol levels can reduce testosterone production and affect libido, muscle, bone mass, and other aspects of testosterone-related biology
- Chronic elevation of cortisol may suppress ovulation in women, but no studies show that taking ADHD medication leads to irregular ovulatory cycles or cessation of menstruation
- **There is no evidence that ADHD medication leads to lower overall testosterone levels**
- The effects of these drugs on hormones should be considered in the context of individual responses and feedback between hormones and productivity
- Prolonged stress is generally unfavorable for the immune and hormone systems
- The treatment of ADHD with these drugs should not come at the expense of other critical biological systems
# **Drug Holidays; Ritalin & Long-Term Effects**
- **Original clinical literature suggested that ADHD medications should not be taken every day**
    - Some medications were designed to be taken during the school week with weekends off or during the school year with vacations in the summer
- Sociological and financial factors have influenced the pattern of intake for ADHD medications
- Different biological and neuroplastic responses occur when taking medication intermittently versus daily over a long period
- Long-term effects of ADHD medications have been studied primarily for methylphenidate (Ritalin)
- Studies on Adderall and Vyvanse, as well as other medications, are limited but exist
- **Most studies on long-term effects focus on adults who were treated with methylphenidate as children**
	- Ritalin was one of the first, so it has tons of studies with new adults
	- - Fewer studies directly address the long-term effects of newer medications like Adderall and Vyvanse
- Studies have shown improvements in executive function in individuals who have taken ADHD medications for months to years
- **Non-amphetamine compounds are now being used more frequently to treat ADHD in both children and adults**
