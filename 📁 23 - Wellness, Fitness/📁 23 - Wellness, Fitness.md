# Wellness Plan and Schedule w/Research

## Constraints, Guides

## NO Alcohol

- Risk with medications
- Impairment
- Lots of unnecessary calories

### Exercise and Activity

- 150 - 200 minutes of zone 2 cardio per week
- As we get older focus on tissue health and not being injured
- Lower weight high rep grows muscle and low rep high weight makes you stronger without getting big
- Challenge muscles not weight

## Difficulties

- Being in a job where exercise isn't core makes things difficult
- Near impossible to have consistent schedule
- Weather

## Schedule

### Sleep

### Morning - Hydration, Caffeine, and Exercise

- Wake up 5-6:30 am

#### Hydration and Salt Intake

- Hydrate 
	- Add salt if low carb diets
	- People on lower carb diets tend to be consuming less processed food – thus limiting their intake of salt.
	- People on lower carb diets are sometimes more active (often due to being more interested in health and weight loss), as exertion and perspiration will deplete your body’s sodium reserves.

#### Pre-Workout Supplements

- Yerba Mate?

## How Many Meals a Day and When?

- Strategy
	- If we can't resist eating, then we should get used to eating the most in the afternoon and eating while still keeping it healthy (not desserts every night or pigging out)
	- Eat first meal 6 - 8 hours after waking up
	- Fast 12 - 16 hours (might be a lot to start)
- Myths
	- "8-hour time-restricted eating linked to a 91% higher risk of cardiovascular death" - [not true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GspirekMLqg&t=40s)
		- Essentially the study concluded that people eating most of their calories in the evening correlated with cardio death.  Could have been people eating unhealthily or really anything. The author even stated this.

## Stimulants

[ADHD and Stimulants](ADHD%20and%20Stimulants/ADHD%20and%20Stimulants.md)

- Why ADHD meds?
	- Hard to focus in environment
	- HARD to focus on tasks that I'm not interested in
	- Transition time to focus and sustainability is undesirable
	- Noticeably low function of neuroplasticity
	- The goal
		- Adjust dosage, timing, and long-term plan
		- Increase neuroplasticity
		- Increase focus
- The strategy
