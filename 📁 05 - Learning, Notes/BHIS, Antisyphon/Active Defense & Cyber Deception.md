# Notes
- Venom vs Poison - poison is moral and better
- One guy had a website that would have Clippy pop up and send them to OWASP to show them how to actually hack.
- Annoyance
    - Hackers don't want to get caught
    - Every hacker feels like a pro till Mr. Clippy pops up and calls them a noob
- Holy crap.  You can do honeydns - makes recon really annoying
    - You can alert when the domains get resolved.
- Changing website banners to make them look like something else
    - You would think this is trivial, but it "rocks proper."
    - This makes vulnerability profiling hard for attackers

## Setting up Cyber Deception Technology SAFELY and/or AT WORK
- Direct connections are a big no-no
    - If you do, then use proxies or chains of them
    - You are dealing with drug dealers, mafia, and tough guys
- They used John's server to find bad people - that could be dangerous
- Don't connect until you have what you need from an IR perspective

- Setup and avoiding attribution
    - Set up ADHD in non-attributable fashion
    - Don't use your own network. Use a 3rd party hosting provider
    - Use vague domain names - advertising server names, cdn, etc.

- Proxy software
    - Use 3rd party anonymizing proxy
    - Tor, VPN software, and anonymizing services are dicey
    - Connecting through Tor, proton mail, or anything else to create an account, then they will ask for driver's licenses sometimes.  They are aware of VPN, tor, and how attackers use them for identity proxies
    - A good option?
        - For tor - whonix or tailsOS
        - Set up a third-party hosted server somewhere
