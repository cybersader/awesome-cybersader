# Notes
- Venom vs Poison - poison is moral and better
- One guy had a website that would have Clippy pop up and send them to OWASP to show them how to actually hack.
- Annoyance
    - Hackers don't want to get caught
    - Every hacker feels like a pro till Mr. Clippy pops up and calls them a noob
- Holy crap.  You can do honeydns - makes recon really annoying
    - You can alert when the domains get resolved.
- Changing website banners to make them look like something else
    - You would think this is trivial, but it "rocks proper."
    - This makes vulnerability profiling hard for attackers
