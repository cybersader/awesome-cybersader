- By John Hammond
- Being a script kiddie is good
- Projector on face for hackeresque photo
- Script kiddie came from about 1994 - live overflow blog post
- It's a lot of intellectual ego and cert bragging
- I use arch btw
- Everyone wants novelty and to do tech trivia on ya
- Everything build off of abstractions and you can't know everything so save some time and don't reinvent the wheel
- They used metasploit to manage all their connections
- People don't like seeing someone willing to communicate down to other people's level whether that be with language, style of video, and how entertaining you are
- Do the risk assessment on which route you should take - copy and paste, tinker, or from scratch
