## The Airport Transportation Fiasco of 2024 - Only my problem really

TL;DR - if you're landing late at a new place without someone picking you up and in a place that isn't busy at night, then just get a rental car.  I'm essentially a noob at traveling, but hey, trial and error.  I ended up paying \$220, an extra hour at the airport, and things went 3 hours past my bedtime.  I paid just as much money as I would have for a rental.   

Here's what happened.  Since I'm a youngin (25 - public information), I'm trying to save a good bit of money in anticipation for a child or 3 or 4 in the future.  In trying to achieve this, I thought that it would be cheaper if I were to just walk everywhere.  WWHF had shuttles for every day and pretty much every time except for the time that I was landing.  The only solutions for transportation at 10:30 PM at night with a one hour drive are: 1) hitch a ride with someone else, 2) rent a car, or 3) get a Lyft or Uber.  Renting a car was about 50+ per day which amounts to about $250 over 4 days.  Hitching a ride is free, but not something that I can rely on.  However, getting a Lyft or Uber could be cheap (supposedly like 40 to 60).  I asked in the WWHF chat if anyone had luck with Lyft, and someone said they did.  However, I didn't take into account the sheer desolation of the Rapid City Airport that would be apparent past 10PM.  I decided to try for an Uber or Lyft.

On the layover before the final landing, I attempted to schedule or ride share ahead of time, but to no avail.  It simply said that they didn't allow them from the location of the Rapid City airport.  What I didn't know at the time was because getting ride shares at that time of night from that low-population region airport was hard - the unreliability being why they don't do scheduled ones.  I tried other options too like chatting in Discord for a ride share, but no one else seemed to be chatting who was on my flight.  I'm also not the pushy type and don't want to intrude, so I didn't directly DM anyone but one person who maybe had the same flight time.  

Here was my plan.  Try for ridesharing and if that doesn't work then simply get a rental as a last resort.  I had some problematic assumptions that were game-breaking here in my risk assessment and planning:
1) I expected that rental places didn't close and at least had someone at the desk throughout the night since they probably don't want you sleeping in the airport.  
2) I assumed that ride sharers couldn't cancel multiple times
3) I assumed my debit cards and credit cards wouldn't get deactivated
4) I assumed I would have good enough internet

Here's how it all went downhill and how it played out.  Everything in the Uber and Lyft apps worked when I made the information.  However, due to using an alias email that forwards to my real one, I got flagged and had to verify my identity with a lengthy process.  Okay I got that working.  Now I just had to get an Uber.  I got two biters, and then they cancelled on me each after about 5 minutes passed.  It was already 10:40 or so.  I tried the Lyft app, but then when I went to get a driver, it failed.  Turns out my cards were locked up and I hadn't set a vacation time range for when and where I would be - rookie mistake.  I tried then for Venmo as a pay source, but then that app wanted me to verify my identity and the internet was bad which wasn't helping.  Next, I tried Paypal and it finally worked.  It took 15 minutes to get someone to bite again up to that point and what was \$110 was now about \$200.  I turned to go to the rentals, knowing that it was about the same price, but they had closed in the past 5 minutes I was looking at my phone.  I was locked in.  All I could do was pray someone would be there, and luckily someone showed up.  I walked outside to get ready even though they were 9 minutes away.  I was alone and it was so silent that I could hear my driver in the distance for about 5 minutes before they had arrived.  Lesson learned...lesson learned. ðŸ˜†

Solution to all of this - **buy a rental car before you leave your hometown**
- that is - if you are in a situation where the airport city is not busy, you have little experience ride sharing, or you're just wondering if transportation will work...especially late at night
