![Scanning Inboxes to Quantify Authentication Weaknesses in the Organization](/üìÅ%2004%20-%20Organizational%20Cyber/‚¨áÔ∏è%20Org%20Cyber%20Drop/Scanning%20Inboxes%20for%20SaaS%20Sprawl%20&%20Visibility.md)

<u>Simple questions here:</u>
- Are use cases for SSO and password managers and other forms of authentication different?
- Are one of the two better?
- What about passkeys?
- If I have Okta, do I still need a password manager?
