- "Master criminal"?
- FBI case agent - wonder what that means? - do they only manage a number of cases at once?
	- primary investigator responsible for managing a specific case. This agent is tasked with leading the investigation, coordinating with other law enforcement and government agencies, and ensuring that all aspects of the case are properly handled

> [!quote] Do case agents only manage that case? How does one get appointed for a specific case? Are they a specific type of agent?


- Here’s how the process generally works:
	1.  **Assignment of Cases**: Case agents are assigned based on various factors, including their expertise, experience, and current workload. In the FBI, each field office and division has a different focus (e.g., counterterrorism, cyber crimes, violent crimes), and agents are typically assigned cases that match their skills and background.
	2.  **Role and Responsibilities**: A case agent is responsible for the overall management of the investigation. This includes gathering and analyzing evidence, interviewing witnesses, collaborating with other agencies, and working with prosecutors if the case goes to trial. The case agent also coordinates the efforts of other team members who may provide support in specific areas like forensics or technical analysis.
	3.  **Types of Agents**: Case agents are not a specific type of agent within the FBI; rather, any agent can be designated as a case agent depending on their assignment. All FBI agents receive a broad training at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, which prepares them to handle a variety of cases, and they may receive additional specialized training based on their roles.
	Becoming a case agent typically reflects a level of trust and responsibility, as these agents must handle sensitive information, make critical decisions about the direction of an investigation, and ensure that all legal and procedural requirements are met.

You mentioned how offices and divisions have different focuses? Do they protect certain divisions or offices more than others then?  Also, do they have to have special skills related to the offices or divisions?

- Yes, the FBI's field offices and divisions do indeed have specialized focuses, and agents typically develop skills pertinent to their assigned division's scope of work. Here’s a bit more on how this specialization and protection of information works:
## Specialization of Offices and Divisions
Each FBI office has a specific operational focus, which might include areas such as: 
- **Counterterrorism** : Agents focus on preventing terrorist attacks, investigating terrorist activities, and managing related threats. 
- **Cyber Crimes** : This focus involves investigating crimes on the internet, including data breaches, cyber fraud, and other computer-related crimes. 
- **Counterintelligence** : Agents work to prevent foreign intelligence services from successfully gathering and collecting sensitive national security information. 
- **Criminal Investigations** : This encompasses a broad range of activities, from white-collar crimes like fraud to violent crimes such as kidnapping and organized crime activities.
## Skills and Training
Agents assigned to specific divisions are often selected based on their backgrounds and skills relevant to the division’s focus. For instance:
- An agent in the Cyber Crimes division might have a background in information technology or computer science.
- Agents in Counterterrorism might have prior military or intelligence experience, or expertise in international relations.
- Those in the Criminal Investigative Division could have experience in law, forensics, or police work.
## Protection and Security Measures
Regarding protection, the FBI ensures that all of its divisions and offices maintain high security, but the nature of the threats and information handled may require specific security measures for certain divisions: 
- **Counterintelligence and Counterterrorism units**  often deal with highly sensitive information that could pose direct threats to national security if compromised. These units may have more stringent security protocols, including higher levels of clearance, more secure communication practices, and restricted access to information. 
- **Cyber Crimes divisions**  require robust digital security measures to protect against hacking and other cyber threats.

Overall, while all areas of the FBI are well-protected and equipped with security measures, those dealing with national security, sensitive intelligence, and cyber threats might operate under even tighter security protocols due to the nature of their work.

> [!quote] How does FBI normally handle claims made about impending danger such as that something bad is going to happen to this person?

- When the FBI receives information about a potential threat or impending danger to an individual, they follow a structured protocol to assess and respond to the threat. Here’s an overview of the typical steps involved: 
1. **Threat Assessment** : The initial step is to assess the credibility and specificity of the threat. This involves determining who made the threat, what exactly is being threatened, when and where the threatened action is supposed to occur, and whether the person making the threat has the capability to carry it out. 
2. **Information Gathering** : The FBI collects as much information as possible about the nature of the threat. This can involve interviewing the person who reported the threat, gathering intelligence on any individuals involved, and working with other law enforcement agencies to get a broader understanding of the context. 
3. **Evaluation** : The information is evaluated against known patterns of threatening behavior and any intelligence that might suggest a real capability and intent to carry out the threat. The FBI uses its own databases, as well as those of other law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to assess the risk. 
4. **Classification** : Depending on the evaluation, the threat may be classified in terms of its seriousness and immediacy. This classification helps determine the level of response required. 
5. **Response** : The response can vary widely based on the assessed threat. It might include: 
- **Monitoring or surveillance**  of suspects if the threat is deemed credible but not immediate. 
- **Protective measures**  for the potential victim, which could include notifying them of the threat, providing a security detail, or advising them on how to enhance their personal security. 
- **Investigation**  to further assess and neutralize the threat. This could involve undercover operations, electronic surveillance, or other investigative techniques. 
6. **Coordination with Other Agencies** : Depending on the nature of the threat, the FBI may work with local police, other federal agencies (like the Secret Service if the threat is against a protected individual), or even international agencies. 
7. **Legal Action** : If the threat is substantiated, legal action such as arrests or charges can be taken against those making the threats, provided there is sufficient evidence.

The overall goal in handling these threats is to prevent any potential harm while respecting legal standards and civil liberties. Each case can vary significantly based on the details of the threat and the context in which it occurs.

> [!quote] How does the FBI classify threats? Is there an actual system or taxonomy for doing so?

- Yes, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies often use a structured system or taxonomy to classify threats. This system helps in assessing the level of danger and determining the appropriate response. The classification typically considers several factors including the credibility, specificity, and imminence of the threat. Here’s a basic outline of how threats might be classified:
## 1. **Credibility**  
- **Credible Threat** : The threat is plausible and the individual making the threat has the capability to carry it out. There might be evidence that the person has access to weapons or has taken steps towards executing the threat. 
- **Non-Credible Threat** : The threat lacks realism or the means to carry it out are not available to the individual.
## 2. **Specificity**  
- **Specific Threat** : Contains detailed information about the means, motive, and opportunity. Specific threats outline clear details about the timing, location, and method of the planned action. 
- **Non-Specific Threat** : Vague or lacks detail about how the threat would be carried out. These threats are more difficult to evaluate and can range widely in their level of danger.
## 3. **Imminence**  
- **Immediate Threat** : Indicates that the action is about to happen and requires urgent response. 
- **Non-Immediate Threat** : Suggests a future action but without immediate plans or preparation evident.
## 4. **Intent and Capacity** 
- This involves assessing whether the individual or group has both the intention to cause harm and the capacity to do so. This includes access to weapons, previous history of similar actions, or logistical capabilities.
## 5. **Contextual Factors** 
- Contextual elements such as ongoing conflicts, political events, or personal grievances can also affect threat classification.

Using these classifications, the FBI can prioritize their responses, allocate resources efficiently, and take appropriate preventive measures. The exact criteria and terminology can vary based on the specific protocols of the FBI and other collaborative agencies, but the general principles of threat assessment are widely adopted in law enforcement and security operations. This structured approach helps ensure that all potential threats are taken seriously while also maintaining rational and resource-efficient responses based on the level of risk posed.

> [!quote] what's the classification system called? I need a reference of it and how the FBI refers to it.

- The FBI does use structured assessment methods to classify and manage threats, but there isn't a public, detailed numerical scoring system for threats like those you might see in other risk assessment models. Instead, the FBI focuses on a variety of factors to assess and prioritize threats, including the credibility, specificity, and imminence of the threat, as well as the intent and capability of the person or group making the threat.

- For instance, the FBI's Behavioral Threat Assessment Center (BTAC) works on understanding and preventing violence by studying past cases and providing training based on behavioral analysis. This approach emphasizes understanding the motives, behaviors, and operational activities of individuals who may pose a threat rather than applying a numerical score to the threat itself​ ([Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-behavioral-threat-assessment-center-releases-lone-offender-terrorism-report) )​.

- In addition, the FBI uses Threat Assessment Teams (TATs), which evaluate threats by considering various risk indicators such as mental health disorders, history of violence, substance abuse, and antisocial behavior. The teams work on a collaborative model involving multiple stakeholders to address potential threats​ ([FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin](https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/featured-articles/threat-assessment-teams-workplace-and-school-violence-prevention) )​.

- These methods show that the FBI’s approach to threat assessment is more qualitative and based on a comprehensive analysis of various factors that contribute to a threat, rather than a simple numerical scoring system. This allows for a more nuanced understanding and response to potential threats. For further details, you can refer to the FBI's resources on threat assessment and management strategies available on their official website.
