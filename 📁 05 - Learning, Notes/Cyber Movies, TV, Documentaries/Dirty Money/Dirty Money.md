# Ep 1: The Wagon Wheel

- Bank tellers
	- Tellers being proactive and helping people 
- Wells Fargo
	- Talks about helping the misfortuned
	- 2008 financial crisis - [Inside Job - 2008 Financial Crisis](../Inside%20Job%20-%202008%20Financial%20Crisis/Inside%20Job%20-%202008%20Financial%20Crisis.md) 
	- They tried to have a folksy image and were the largest bank in the world (bigger than the Chinese ones at one point)
	- They were around since the 1800s
	- "I knew why they hired me.  To smile to their customers...to make them feel welcome, so we could steal their money"

- Training illusion
	- 1 month long training
	- They'd talk a lot about what NOT to do - code of ethics
		- Don't issue ATM cards to people that don't request it
		- Don't issue credit cards to people that don't request it or don't need them
		- Don't open accounts without consent
	- Let me sign that form
	- This is a no brainer
	- "These things are exactly what they were doing"

- Opening accounts with employees
	- "Open this account. It's easy."
	- "I already have a account."
	- "Oh.  Don't worry it's a free checking account."
	- "I was really pissed off...After I had my quota I understand why she did that."

- Interview with CEO "Stumpf"
	- Q: What do you look for when you hire?
	- A: We look for attitude and teach for aptitude
		- We don't care how much you know till we know how much you care

- Bad (KPIs) - key performance indicators
	- "How many accounts do you commit to opening today?"
	- "8 makes great."

- "Cross-selling"
	- Term was started by Wells Fargo
	- "Higher stock price"
	- "Wells Fargo has the kind of growth from its "stores" (branches) that most would kill for...you'll leave with far more product than you might expect...annualized over a lifetime."
	- How many products can you tie a consumer into? - that's cross selling
	- Examples:
		- Checking and savings with direct deposit tied in
		- Then you get them their mortgage in, retirement, credit card, etc.
	- That's the wagon wheel
	- "80 different businesses"
	- 'Not cross selling...they are ranked low on our "trust" ladders'
	- Banks have shareholders.  They want growth and execs want it for money.
	- "Oh you have a problem...we have a product for that."
	- "Why didn't you meet your goals today."
	- Ludicrously dubious micro-management.
	- If the bankers get the numbers, than everyone above them gets bonuses.  If they don't, they all get threatened.
	- They had a "family and friends" day where they have to double the numbers, so many workers had to turn to friends or families. *cringe*
	- They started opening accounts for fake people, breaking the law, or even for children.
