> [!tldr] This movie is an ironic intersection of my fear of buzzing insects yet love of honeybees, and my not-so-much love but study of cybercrime, and phishing...wow.  Either this will be an absolute bop or an absolute flop

# Notes
- Don't remember beekeepers having such fancy suits 😆
- Don't remember phishers being this fancy either.  It's usually the peons doing the first step call work. This is a bit unrealistic in that regard. Also...the scam scall center looks like a rave with some dressed up people. They don't pay the callers enough to afford clothing like that.
- The phish:
	- "You have an older version of this software. Take computer to IT specialist to replace hard drive...actually we have a remote software to account for this. Go to friendly friend dot com."
	- Downloaded stealer malware that was sophisticated
	- We put 500 into this account. Can you login and verify this? They steal passwords mid-login and talk about accidentally giving them too much money.
	- Type in password for bank account - malware logs it
- Other than the flashy malware and the computer not setting off any alarm bells, not bad. 🤔
- 12 minutes in
- Lady killed herself...not unrealistic so say that phishers and scammers have resulted in actual death. 😔

- Cybercrime office knows they've been operating for two years with no names.  Nahhhh..it's not that hard to find these guys.
- Hard to build and indictment against them?  "They would just argue they agreed to do it." 
	- A bit unbelievable

- Bro's a secret agent that hid his secret encrypted tunnel phones in bee hives.  😆 -- gold
- 21 minutes in.  Jason Statham is standing in the call center room already with two buckets of gasoline ready to light the place on fire...

> [!quote] Sometimes I use fire to smoke out the hornets

- No way. Our boy Pita Bread from Hunger Games is a call center mastermind.
- 30 minutes in and they already found his bees.  I swear this is about to turn into Keanu Reeves John Wick if they miss with his bees.

- They did it...they really did.
- A little over the top with the violence and vulgarity, but I'll stick around.  It's so outlandish though that there's some comedy to it

> [!failure] Vengeance is not justice...just to be clear, and it surely isn't moral

- The guy getting thrown into the river by the car looked so fake and ragdoll-like 😆...good job on that one.  Realistic violence in movies subverts human dignity - at least when they use it for shock factor
- They keep showing Josh/Derek and mentioning how well known and powerful he is.  Seems like his mom is the president or something
- Yup...she's the president 
- The company with the malware and victim targeting software is headed by the president
