# Day 1
- There's infinity to God's being/goodness and he reveals himself in our time and our limits
- Love goodness and the Trinity are everything.  It's a mystery that's communicated to us by and for love in our time.  We experience that mystery through faith
- By God and for God
- He made us because he loves us and wants us to share in him and that's a mystery.
- love story out of the Bible and out of life is a meaningless to-do list
- Joy is knowing you've already won and not that you're winning
- Notice that understanding God's love cannot be fully realized with intellect or reason.  It's given by using our will to ask for God to be in our lives which gives us faith.
- Psalm 4
- Jonathan pagaeu carving to show part of God even though he has infinite detail
- How we can be redeemed in suffering in the times where our minds or bodies are barely there
- Do u pray for abandonment to self?
# Day 2
- Eucharist gives us the grace to anticipate eternal life
- Thrown down your cloak - your worldly safety
- Pride can stop us from calling out
- Take courage - blind man didn't know the world like other people

- Peter said I'm the wrong guy - Jesus said follow me
- Salvation in Christ and Christianity are an answer to sin and to suffering
- Breaking spiritual laws breaks us

- Our identity isn't our sin or suffering but as sons and daughters of our Father
- We can't water down what Jesus teaches
- Humanity is incapable of solving the problem of sin
- Jesus is the answer
- Grace lifts up fallen human nature - recognize/define grace by its result?
- We don't need to be missionaries or volunteering at a food pantry to love our Lord.  Love your wife, your family, your close friends, and the ones you are responsible for and yet be generous

- By faith and not by sight/proof
- Sit in your electric chair and follow me 

- The cross is the worst thing we did to the most loving person - and yet the best thing ever done for us
- The cross is arbitrary but gruesome and dark - no matter where we are he is with us
- God wants to love us in the mess and be in that

- A babys identity is in their mom and dad before they say a word
- Our identity is in the face of Christ on the cross
- There are many mysteries bigger than us, things we will never understand, but that's not the point.  Its a simple question..are you going to follow the person who loves you more than you could ever know? 

- Your sin, failure, and trauma are one page in the book and not bigger than God
- Grace renovated human nature to a super nature - new life giving principle in human soul - healing, transformation of our lives - enables us to return to the likeness of God like Adam and Eve before the fall - the kind of creatures fully giving to God and desiring to live with him
- Nothing material is guaranteed, but following Jesus will change you for the better. 
- The same God asks for us to carry our cross right now.  The same one from the sea of Galilee
