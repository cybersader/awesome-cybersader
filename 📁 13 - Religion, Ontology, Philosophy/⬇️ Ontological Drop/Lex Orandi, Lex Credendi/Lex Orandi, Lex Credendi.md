The phrase is typically rendered in Latin as **_Lex orandi, lex credendi_** (not “orondi”). It translates roughly to “**The law of prayer [is] the law of belief**.” In other words, **how** the Church (or a believer) prays—its liturgy, worship, and devotional practices—shapes and reflects **what** it believes (its doctrines or theology).

A common extended form you might see is **_Lex orandi, lex credendi, lex vivendi_**, meaning “**As we pray, so we believe, and so we live**.” This highlights that prayer (or worship), belief, and daily life are all interconnected.
