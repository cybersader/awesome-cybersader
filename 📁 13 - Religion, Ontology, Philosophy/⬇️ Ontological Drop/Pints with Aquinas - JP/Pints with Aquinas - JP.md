> [!info] A reflection of the discussion

- Atheism, climate change, marriage advice
- Carnivore diet
    - Can work for some people by changing a lot of processes in body
    - Misses ice cream and dairy and sugar
    - You don't need carbs you don't need sugars you don't need fiber
    - Protein only diet helps with seizures
    - Treatment centers based on carnivore to treat manic depressive order and depression with unknown symptoms
    - Thought to potentially be metabolic diseases resulting in inflammation
    - Anecdotes arent data but they suggest something
- We are being tutored by the internet and the means by which we use it
    - We don't know how to be confident with all the conflicts
    - Most of what passes for settled science isn't settled
    - Lots of disagreement about even the most fundamental things - climate
- Climate science
    - CO2 over last millions shows we are really low by 1850 - plants die at 250 and we were at 350
    - They have been increasing maybe to man made stuffâ€¦maybe
    - Now we are at low 400s - maybe from industrial output
    - Planet is 20% greener than in 2000. This is obvious from satellite data
    - Crop yield up by 13%?
    - Deserts are shrinking because plants breathe through stomata. When there's not much CO2, the stomata have to be open and the water evaporates. Increasing water makes the stomata close more and they don't need as much water
    - Is greening good? - more plants and crops grow better, but the rapid rate of change can destabilize ecosystems
	- The issue of climate studies are that the timescales are too short
	- Some people believe that fossil fuel usage could've potentially reversed desertification for a good bit
- Population bomb nonsense, soylent green
	- Two men had bet on whether commodities would go up or down 20 years later with population
	- The prices went down
	- Zero-Sum Malthusianism is silly
		- Don't listen to Thanos
	- Human life is not like yeast in a petri dish. It's the wrong biological model
	- Who doesn't get what they need. 
	- Taking fossil fuels away from developing countries hurts them
	- It can be argued that this is akin to biblical child sacrifice when we sacrifice cattle to "change the weather."
	- What really is the environment/nature? - it's begging the question
	- C-40 consortium - [C40 Cities - A global network of mayors taking urgent climate action](https://www.c40.org/) 
- Energy price impacts
	- If energy prices go up, then the poor suffers
		- Pareto distribution - people at the top have virtually everything
		- A few rivers have most water, a few stars most stellar mass, a few blood vessels have most blood - all of it relates to entropy
		- The bottom has people barely hanging on
		- 1% employment down means 5% psychiatric hospitilization
	- Cranking up energy prices is dangerous
	- Sacrificing the poor for planetary messianism
	- Get rid of carbon dioxide or human beings? - the supposed question 
	- The poor discount the future, so they live for the moment and will burn up the future
	- Driving cost of energy down could help
- Environment sustainability spread
	- Good scientists are skeptical and know how to evaluate data
	- We could drive the energy costs down with good technology if everyone valued it
	- Free markets are good
- Online feedback, confrontational nature, and being an agreeable person
	- Verbal tricks
