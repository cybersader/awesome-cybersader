# Live Sync with File Shares / File-Level

- https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-sync-live-team-collaborative-editing/6058/10
	- https://docs.pears.com/
		- One way to implement this is that the participants control their vault, a directory synchronized in P2P. Technically it can use a protocol such as https://pears.com/, perhaps using Beaker. Then one can ‚Äòmount‚Äô several directories (vaults) of people you want to follow. And then use obsidian on top to see in real-time any change that happens.

# Workaround Methods - VS Code, Github.dev

- If hosted in GitHub you can use the github.dev editor with the LiveShare plugin
- You could also hook up to your vault then use the same LiveShare Plugin
