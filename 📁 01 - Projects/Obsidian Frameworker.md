
I'm trying to build a tool that can be used to map plaintext files in markdown to taxonomical frameworks with a variety of built-in features such as using YAML frontmatter on note pages, import process for CSV file mapping or tabular versions, 2 way sync with those files, workflows, and more.

- What's the system fundamentally doing?
    - We are taking strict taxonomies/hierarchies and representing them in a way that can be easily interfaced and machine-readable
    - We are using a many components to represent these taxonomies or nested key:value pair systems:
        - Plaintext files with markdown
        - Inline tagging
        - YAML frontmatter - nested information about a singular node
        - Paths (relative or absolute) to other notes
            - Linking
            - Like a "graph"
        - How to represent an "edge" like in a graph but with particular values?
            - EXAMPLE: this page shows evidence of compensating control for this other reference framework page
    - Using the "graph"
        - We have to tell it how to pull the data out (below)

- Relationships between MD pages - links and graphs
    - How do graph DBs represent information about relationships between 2 nodes?

    - At nodes --
        - Use queries - for generating editable, versionable tables, require dates for changes or just serialize it on nodes in the form of some table that can be edited.  This might be hard
        - At edges - use templates for the to/from set of available key value pairs.  Templates could be in the YAML frontmatter or stored in some other format inline within the note using code blocks
    - Allow for inline connections to other note pages using some crazy inline format

- Connection/edge templates for graph system
    - Store them per node (note page).  Templates can be defined globally per type of note page based on a tag in YAML frontmatter, or you can have value choices for key_value pairs in the edges, global templates

- Include frameworks out-of-the-box with support from the framework makers

- Merging/searching/exporting a path in the graph/structure?
    - We could flatten with particular key:value choices down to a certain layer
    - Use cypher queries with the notes?
    - Somehow would need to use graph-based connections, potentially index them (SUPER HARD), and allow for building two-way synced tables (or not) 

- How does OSCAL fit in?
    - OSCAL to YAML frontmatter?

- Storing, importing, and exporting templates for these framework setups?
    - Use some template format or system?
    - Definition files?
    - OSCAL?
