# Transferring Data & New SIM (Mint Mobile)

	- Don't cancel current plan until completing the Mint activation process
	- Contact your current carrier to request your Account Number, Number Transfer PIN or PIN (Note: Varies by carrier.), and Billing Zip Code. You’ll need this information to transfer your old number while completing the step-by-step Mint Mobile activation.
