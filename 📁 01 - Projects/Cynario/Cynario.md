# Implementations

## 1) Using Obsidian with Markdown Pages + Links

- Create a plugin in Obsidian to be used with Obsidian Publish
- Create graphs of scenarios with links to events
- Markdown is easy, so it's really easy to setup
- Would be easiest if you could create the scenario from graph view (likely just some other plugins)
