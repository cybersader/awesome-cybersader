# Immich

> Immich integrates photo and video storage with a web portal and mobile app. It includes features such as libraries, automatic backup, bulk upload, partner sharing, Typesense search, facial recognition, and reverse geocoding.

>TrueNAS SCALE makes installing Immich easy, but you must use the Immich web portal and mobile app to configure accounts and access libraries.
# TrueNAS Immich App Setup

## Dataset Configuration
> You can allow SCALE to create the datasets Immich requires automatically during app installation. Or before beginning app installation, [create the datasets](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/scaletutorials/datasets/datasetsscale/) to use in the **Storage Configuration** section during installation. Immich requires seven datasets: **library**, **pgBackup**, **pgData**, **profile**, **thumbs**, **uploads**, and **video**. You can organize these as one parent with seven child datasets, for example mnt/tank/immich/library, mnt/tank/immich/pgBackup, and so on.

In this case, I'm making an Immich dataset, then 7 child datasets for each of the storage components mentioned in the Immich configuration.

- Add parent dataset under app folders
	- In this case, I have an `immich` folder as the parent
- Created child datasets

### Dataset Permissions and User Ownership
The installation process of the immich app should handle the below configuration for you, but it's there if need be.

- The **pgData** dataset must be owned by the user `netdata` (UID 999) for postgres to start. The other datasets must be owned by the user `root` (UID 0) or a group that includes the user `root` (UID 0) for immich to have the necessary permissions.
## Immich App Settings
- Add the datasets or use the auto-generated ixVolume setting
	- ![](IMG-20240624195831636.png)
- Allocate GPU resources to Immich if you want
- Deploy
## Note on Updates
- When updates become available, SCALE alerts and provides easy updates.
## Immich Environment Variables
> Before installing the Immich app in SCALE, review their [Environment Variables](https://documentation.immich.app/docs/install/environment-variables) documentation and to see if you want to configure any during installation. You can configure environment variables at any time after deploying the application.

## Immich Web Portal
- Go to the app and click `web portal` or just type in the TrueNAS ip with the port into a browser
- ![](IMG-20240624195831710.png)
- Create first admin account
- Login
# Setup Public Domain & Remote Access - Cloudflare Tunnels
- Cloudflare Account is already set up
- Zero Trust dashboard
- Already have domain for my home lab and self-hosting stuff
- Tunnel already set up for TrueNAS stuff
	- ![](IMG-20240624195831791.png)
- Configure the tunnel > Public Hostname > Add a public hostname
	- ![](IMG-20240624195831849.png)
# Client Setup
- Simply download the Android (Google Play) or iOS (App Store) clients, put the server URL in, and log in
## Client Approach and Bugs
- I want to divide things up at the remote/immich by putting them into albums
- Had trouble creating albums on clients even though I hit create.  Did it no computer instead
