[TrueNAS Scale - Nginx Proxy Setup](../TrueNAS%20Scale%20-%20Nginx%20Proxy%20Setup/TrueNAS%20Scale%20-%20Nginx%20Proxy%20Setup.md)
[Turning Old PC into NAS in 2024](../Turning%20Old%20PC%20into%20NAS%20in%202024/Turning%20Old%20PC%20into%20NAS%20in%202024.md)

I managed to get Nginx Proxy Manager [working in TrueNAS](../TrueNAS%20Scale%20-%20Nginx%20Proxy%20Setup/TrueNAS%20Scale%20-%20Nginx%20Proxy%20Setup.md).

For some reason, I'm getting errors with "too many redirects."  Nextcloud ironically works on my local network, so let's solve it.

# Solution

Turns out I mentioned this awhile back  too - [Turning Old PC into NAS in 2024](../Turning%20Old%20PC%20into%20NAS%20in%202024/Turning%20Old%20PC%20into%20NAS%20in%202024.md)

Solution explained in depth - [Setting the Nextcloud host](https://forums.truenas.com/t/a-full-guide-for-installing-nextcloud-on-truenas-scale-with-collabora-integration-and-outside-access-through-nginx-proxy-manager/5874#p-21918-setting-the-nextcloud-host-7) 

You have to set the host to your `subdomain.domain.com` and check the "Use different port for URL rewrites" box.
