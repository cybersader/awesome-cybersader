# Big Features for New Version

- Will actually work with Storj...this is huge.  
	- Storj caused me $700 in losses with a backup issue because iX-Systems' Cloud Sync function was bad
	- [iX-Storj Overcharging or Overusing Storage](../iX-Storj%20Overcharging%20or%20Overusing%20Storage/iX-Storj%20Overcharging%20or%20Overusing%20Storage.md)
- Docker container support
	- Can pretty much use any open source tool out there now in my TrueNAS server
