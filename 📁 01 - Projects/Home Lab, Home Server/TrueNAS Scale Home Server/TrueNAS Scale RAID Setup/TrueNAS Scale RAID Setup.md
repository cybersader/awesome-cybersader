I'm finally adding another drive to my home server.

# VDEVs & Disks Explained
**VDEVs (Virtual Devices)** are like building blocks for your storage pool in TrueNAS Scale. Imagine you're constructing a wall. Each brick is a VDEV, and the entire wall is your storage pool. When you add a new drive, you're essentially adding another brick to that wall.

Here's a simple way to think about it:

1. **RAID 0** is like stacking bricks one after another. It's fast, but if one brick (drive) fails, the whole wall collapses.
    
2. If you want redundancy (protection against a drive failure), you need a different type of RAID setup within your VDEV. Common choices are:
    
    - **RAID 1 (Mirroring)**: Every brick has an identical twin. If one fails, the twin keeps things standing.
    - **RAID 5**: This is like having a special brick that holds the secret recipe to rebuild any lost brick. You need at least three bricks for this.
    - **RAID 6**: Similar to RAID 5 but with an extra secret recipe brick for even more protection. Requires at least four bricks.

In your case, you’re moving from RAID 0 (no redundancy) to something with redundancy. Let’s say you choose RAID 5. When you add a new drive, you'll reorganize your existing and new drives into a RAID 5 setup within the VDEV. This means if one drive fails, the data can be rebuilt using the information from the remaining drives.

**Steps to do this:**

1. **Backup Your Data:** Always start with a backup.
2. **Add the New Drive:** Physically install the new drive in your TrueNAS system.
3. **Reconfigure the Pool:** Use the TrueNAS Scale interface to change your pool setup from RAID 0 to RAID 5 or another redundant option. This might involve some downtime and data migration.

By doing this, you’re adding that extra layer of protection, ensuring your data stays safe even if a drive fails.
# Adding a Drive to Current Pool, Upgrading to RAID 1 (Two Drives)

- Just to be clear, I'm not rich and therefore I had to slowly buy drives.  I started with 1 drive - hence RAID 0.  Now I have 2 drives which is why I'm moving to a mirrored setup for basic redundancy.

- Some people seem to think it's simple to upgrade from RAID 0 (1 drive without redundancy) to RAID 1 (mirrored mode)

# Expanding an Existing Pool
- TL;DR - you can't just add one drive to the pool...well actually you kind of can?

- ZFS uses Data VDEVs
	- ![400](IMG-20240630195146526.png)
- VDEVs don't need same size
	- ![400](IMG-20240630195146576.png)
- VDEV does not need to be symmetrical size or drive count
	- ![400](IMG-20240630195146623.png)
- Mirrors
	- You can use this but it's expensive for storage
	- ![400](IMG-20240630195146696.png)
- You can have many pools
	- Datasets are not shared between pools
	- ![400](IMG-20240630195146794.png)
- Losing a VDEV loses the pool
