> [!tldr] When using Immich with Cloudflare, you may run into errors when uploading photos or video.  It seems that the proxy has inherent limits per request.  Immich needs to implement a "chunked" approach for such cases.

	- Users can deploy a custom reverse proxy that forwards requests to Immich. This way, the reverse proxy can handle TLS termination, load balancing, or other advanced features. All reverse proxies between Immich and the user must forward all headers and set the `Host`, `X-Real-IP`, `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-For` headers to their appropriate values. Additionally, your reverse proxy should allow for big enough uploads. By following these practices, you ensure that all custom reverse proxies are fully compatible with Immich.

# The Why/Issue
- Cloudflare uses other networks and limits request sizes to 100 MB.  Even if you chunk it with [Chunked transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding#:~:text=Chunked%20transfer%20encoding%20is%20a,received%20independently%20of%20one%20another.), you still run into the issue where the cache for Cloudflare [fills up](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/1674). The mobile app allows, seemingly, up to 1 GB now. 

# The Solution
Can't use Cloudflare Tunnels until Immich implements chunking from their clients to the server. This will need to be done on the mobile app and the web client.

The request needs to be broken up into pieces on the client application side and then streamed over to the server in chunks.  There are libraries for doing this that they're trying to implement.

There is a feature request for this currently - [[Feature]: Upload large files in chunks · immich-app/immich · Discussion #1674](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/1674)

Ironically, this was mentioned last week.
