# Storage Options - 12 TB Backup

The gist:
- AWS S3 Glacier Deep Archive - good option, but the restore and download costs can be at least $90 per TB ($1116 for 12 TB), but can be as cheap as $150 a year
- Backblaze B2 - $864 per year for 12 TB, simple pricing, and only costs about $120 for restore and downloading the data
- iX-Storj - $576 per year 12 TB or $150 per 5 TB per year. $84 for restore/download/egress. 

- [iX Storj](https://www.truenas.com/ix-storj/)
	- [TrueNAS iX-Storj Cloud Storage: Secure Data Solutions](https://www.truenas.com/ix-storj/) 
	- $576 per year 12 TB or $150 per 5 TB per year
	- X-Storj provides S3-Compatible cloud storage atÂ [$4/TB per month](https://www.storj.io/pricing)Â and a starter package at $150 per year for 5 Terabytes, an unbeatable value.
	- $7 per TB egress - $84 for 12 TB

		- One of the suggestions was investigating a storage service from a partner of iXsystems, iX-Storj - while the raw per-TB storage costing is higher than Glacier ($4/TB/mo for storage) it's cheaper than standard S3, and the restoration cost is $7/TB - cheaper than Glacier. Easier to sync and manage, no ingress costing.
	- [iX and Storj Deliver Globally Distributed Storage to TrueNAS](https://www.ixsystems.com/blog/ix-and-storj-deliver-globally-distributed-storage-to-truenas/)
		- **AWS S3 Glacier vs iX-Storj**: The iX-Storj service is identical to the standard Storj service at $4 per TB per month*. This compares with single-region AWS S3 at $25 per TB per month. Bandwidth (egress) prices for iX-Storj are $7/TB* compared with AWS at $90/TB. 80% lower in price, or for the same price, store 5X the data with iX-Storj with the added value of multi-region durability.

	- $0.00099Â per GB * 12000 * 12 months = $142.56 US
	- Data retrieval cost = $0.01 * 12000 = $120
	- All data transfer in = $0.00Â per GB

		- Best to download files once every 3 months, if youâ€™re ok waiting:Â **Glacier Deep Archive: $2/month**, plus a 12-hour delay and $24 per terabyte fee data retrieval fee and $92.16 per terabyte download fee, and minimum storage of 6 months (plus per-file request fees that can add up quite a bit more than the base download pricing).

		- I have had a similar situation in the past and here's what I did as an alternative to HoneyBadger's excellent suggestion.  
			1. AWS has a device called a Snowball ([https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/](https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/)) that one can rent for a fee. You may want to check that out. I had ~35TB that I needed in Glacier and my upload speeds were abysmal and would have taken forever. After contacting AWS, they sent me the snowball device where I uploaded all of my data to it. Once my data was on the device, I sent it back to them where they ingested it into my S3 account. 
			2. Going forward, I am using native AWS CLI S3 tools on my TrueNAS SCALE box for S3 cloud sync tasks. Using the TrueNAS cloud sync tasks does not work well for me because the options aren't granular enough for my use cases as it insists on re-uploading all of my now ~50TB worth of data. I created a script that is kicked off by a systemd timer 2x a week, and it only uploads the changes from the previous sync. Using native AWS CLI tools does have the option to delete files from Glacier.

	- Besides the per-GB, per-month fee, any blob that moves to the Archive tier will be subject to a 180-day Archive early deletion window.
- Backblaze
	- [Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison: Calculate Your Costs](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage/pricing) 
	- $6 * 12 TB * 12 months = $864
	- Restore is around $120 or so for 12 TB

## iX-Storj Setup

- [TrueNAS Integration with Storj for Secure Data Storage - Storj Docs](https://docs.storj.io/dcs/third-party-tools/ix-systems-truenas) 
- https://docs.storj.io/dcs/third-party-tools/ix-systems-truenas#setting-up-storj
- Steps:
	- Create a bucket
	- Generate S3 creds
		- **access key**,Â **secret key**, andÂ **endpoint**
		- Permissions:
			- All
			- Buckets: created bucket here
			- No expiration date needed
	- Access encryption
		- use same passphrase as Storj account or use separate passphrase
		- Save this into password manager
		- In order to see the data uploaded to your bucket in the web console, you must unlock the bucket with the same encryption passphrase as the credentials.

## Connecting TrueNAS to iX-Storj 

- Go into TrueNAS UI
- Create a Cloud Credential / Backup Credentials
- Use the creds from Storj
- Create a Cloud Sync Task in Data Protection menu
	- Add a Cloud Sync task
	- Direction: PUSH
	- Transfer Mode: COPY
	- Credential: Storj-related credential
	- Bucket: TrueNAS bucket created within Storj
	- Folder (optional): path where data should be stored
	- Directory/Files: folder in directory to push from
		- Don't select mnt -- use one of the mounted datasets below it.  In my case, I'm using my `personal` dataset

# Bad Digest Error

[Scheduled Backups, Scheduled Downtime](../Scheduled%20Backups,%20Scheduled%20Downtime/Scheduled%20Backups,%20Scheduled%20Downtime.md) 

> Attempt 3/3 failed with 3 errors and: BadDigest: The Content-Md5 you specified did not match what we received.

- [amazon s3 - An exception "The Content-MD5 you specified did not match what we received" - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36179310/an-exception-the-content-md5-you-specified-did-not-match-what-we-received)
	- I think I have solved my problem. I finally found that some of my files actually changed during the uploading. Because the file is generated by another thread, the uploading and generating is done at the same time. The file can not be generated immediately, and during the generating of a file, it may be uploading at the same time, the file actually changed during the uploading.
	- The md5 of file is created at the beginning of uploading by the AmazonS3Client, then the whole file is uploaded to the S3, at this time, the file is different from the file uploaded at beginning, so the md5 actually changed. I modified my program to a single-threading program, and the problem never turned up again.
- Other example of error: [Failed to copy: BadDigest: The Content-Md5 you specified did not match what we received - Help and Support - rclone forum](https://forum.rclone.org/t/failed-to-copy-baddigest-the-content-md5-you-specified-did-not-match-what-we-received/38176)

## TrueNAS Scale Cloud Backup Failure Solution

- rclone failed with exit code 3
	- [I have resolved my issue. I unchecked the &quot;Take Snapshot&quot; option from the task.](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/cloud-sync-task-to-b2-error.83879/)
	- After hours and hours of troubleshooting, In order to get rid of that exact error I had to exclude my Desktop folder from the sync, everything sync'd successfully after that. I believe it has something to do with either the shortcuts, recycle bin, symlinks or file name length, I could be wrong.
	- Some people seem to think it could be a filename length issue.

- I turned off ALL of my apps and it FINALLY WORKED
