# üìö About | The Wiki

My public and contributable base/wiki for cybersecurity, cyber resilience, and cyber-related topics. Utilizes Notion, Obsidian, and Github to sync content.

> A beacon for the assembly and dissemination of cyber wisdom, this platform stands as a formidable citadel, a testament to my dedication as a Cybersader, committed to enriching the collective intellect. Initially serving as a crucible for my own insights, it is adorned with the digital ramparts and moats designed to safeguard knowledge. Yet, its ambition extends far beyond, aspiring to evolve into a dynamic, contributory nexus for the cyber-savvy and the intellectually studious. This endeavor is the essence of social knowledge curation‚Äîa concept pioneered by Wikipedia, yet here, under the banner of the Cybersader, I seek to refine and reimagine its potential. My vision is to build not just a platform, but a fortress of wisdom, more intuitive in its use and replicable, allowing others to establish resilient bastions of cyber knowledge across the realm. Here, every contribution is forged in fire, every shared insight a shield to the industry, paving the way for an unprecedented expansion of cyber knowledge landscapes, under the watchful eye of the Cybersader.
