I've had canker sores for 20 years now and have figured out how to manage the pain and heal them quickly.

# Prevention

- Multivitamin
	- B-12
	- L-lysine
- If you cut your mouth, start using oral debriding mouthwash or anything with a debriding agent in it

# For the small ones

- Benzocaine during meals if need be
	- Kanka soft brush
	- Any gel with benzocaine for the mouth
	- Use the menthol + hydrogen peroxide mix mouth wash when you brush

# Major aphthous ulcers (big canker sores)

- If it start going over your lip, giving you a fever, or making your teeth ache, then here is your protocol.

- If it's necessary, you can get an paste-based corticosteroid cream to speed healing, but it will decrease your immune system

- Pain relief:
	- Ibuprofen or Acetaminophen (doesn't do much for the localized pain)
	- Numbing:
		- BLM (Benadryl, Maalox, and Lidocaine) mouthwash
		- Benzocaine pastes, Kanka softbrush
		- Ziacin-b
		- Menthol - really effective
		- Menthol patches work well if it's on your lip and you don't need to talk much
		- Hexlresorcinol - there are lozenges with this in it and it's AWESOME feeling

- Cauterization
	- The best option
		- Go into the dentist if you can get an appointment 
		- Have them treat it with a laser.  It can keep them away from the same spot permanently sometimes.
	- Silver nitrate sticks
