- All of these options will essentially run Obsidian somewhere else with mechanisms in place to make other essentials work:
	- Syncing
	- User Management
	- Community Plugin Management
	- Networking
	- Security

There's only one option that seems like it could scale and that's [Kasm Workspaces](../../üìÅ%2005%20-%20Organizational%20Cyber/Remote%20Desktop%20Gateways/Kasm%20Workspaces/Kasm%20Workspaces.md) but the general solution are [Remote Desktop Gateways](../../üìÅ%2005%20-%20Organizational%20Cyber/Remote%20Desktop%20Gateways/Remote%20Desktop%20Gateways.md)

- [Apache Guacamole](../../../üìÅ%2005%20-%20Organizational%20Cyber/Remote%20Desktop%20Gateways/Apache%20Guacamole/Apache%20Guacamole.md)
- [Kasm Workspaces](../../../üìÅ%2005%20-%20Organizational%20Cyber/Remote%20Desktop%20Gateways/Kasm%20Workspaces/Kasm%20Workspaces.md)
