# Why Obsidian is Better than OneNote
    - Manage knowledge, projects, tasks, diagrams and everything in Obsidian
    - Obsidian is free, malleable with plugins, private, and simple
    - The files for Obsidian live where we need them to in our file share
    - OneNote Cons:
        ○ Bad for task management and prioritization
            § Little to no easy scalable way to manage tasks
            § You could move to Microsoft Todo and complicate things but then your task management is decoupled from documentation, notetaking, and day to day work other than through your calendar…managing tasks from the calendar gets tired
        ○ Slow and clunky interface
        ○ Formatting that doesn't paste well in other places
        ○ No way to automate with what's in their - Obsidian has simple APIs and you can make your own plugin
        ○ Terrible attachment features.
        ○ Can't store other filetypes alongside easily.
        ○ Hard to migrate out of.
        ○ Exports can't be customized
    - Obsidian Benefits:
        ○ Malleable - transparent plugin system, make the interface into what you need, integrates with tools you need it to, simple and intuitive
        ○ Plaintext folders and files - Obsidian is merely an interface to manage plaintext/markdown files
        ○ Project and task management features
        ○ Place to work in to manage documentation, notes, and everything in one place - you're just interacting with plaintext files.  You can use well-known export features with plugins like Pandoc - customizable exports.
        ○ Easy to link notes together.
        ○ Easy to manage attachments - they just sit in the filesystem your vault is interacting with.
        ○ Easy to migrate from.
        ○ Great search plugins and features to find what you need in your notes
