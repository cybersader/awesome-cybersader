# Stack Ideas
- Mobile Dropzone Vault -> GitHub [repo-file-sync-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action) -> Main vault ([awesome-cyber](https://github.com/cybersader/awesome-cyber)) -> [File Organizer 2000](File%20Organizer%202000/File%20Organizer%202000.md)  (dropzone folder in main vault)
	- Create a dropzone vault that connects to the main vault via the repo file sync action GitHub action
	- Runs [File Organizer 2000](File%20Organizer%202000/File%20Organizer%202000.md) right when the main vault is opened on a client
- Mobile note taking app -> Share to FileOrganizer with some new integration from them?
- Try having main vault on mobile and simply only using the FileOrganizer 2000 dropzone folder
