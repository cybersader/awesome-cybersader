- [ ] Implement Syncthing for Obsidian Desktop and mobile clients âž• 2024-04-26

> [!tldr] Syncing an Obsidian vault from desktop to mobile / other desktops. 
> 
> It all depends on the initial "source of truth" for your files to first sync to other destinations/clients. In this case, I set up Syncthing on desktop to sync my files to an obsidian folder on my phone.  

> [!info] [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) does work for this as well. However, I ran into several issues related to git conflicts that were the result of plugins that modify the edit date with a plugin like "[obsidian-linter](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter)" or "[update-time-on-edit-obsidian](https://github.com/beaussan/update-time-on-edit-obsidian)"

> [!tip] My reasoning for using Syncthing rather than just [Obsidian Git](../../Obsidian%20Git/Obsidian%20Git.md) is to make sure that files are being properly synced right when they change between my clients -- immediately 
> 
> ðŸ¤” My whole reason for syncing is to be able to take notes on-the-go and have them synced.  However, I think the better option here may be to have a dropzone that syncs Obsidian or a specific folder on mobile - such as [File Organizer 2000](../../Auto%20-%20Tagging,%20Linking,%20Dropzones%20&%20Organizers/File%20Organizer%202000/File%20Organizer%202000.md) or other [Dropzones & Organizers](../../Auto%20-%20Tagging,%20Linking,%20Dropzones%20&%20Organizers/Auto%20-%20Tagging,%20Linking,%20Dropzones%20&%20Organizers.md)
# Preparing Obsidian on Mobile
1. Download Syncthing from an app store
	1. The Android app is available onÂ [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nutomic.syncthingandroid)Â andÂ [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/).
2. Choose and/or create a new local folder from "Create new vault" in Obsidian Mobile

# Syncthing Desktop Setup
- [Download](https://github.com/Bill-Stewart/SyncthingWindowsSetup/releases/) Syncthing for Desktop (Windows)
	- https://syncthing.net/downloads/ 

> [!example] [Getting Started â€” Syncthing documentation](https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html)

- Start Syncthing

> [!warning] You'll need firewall rule exceptions (it will likely ask to enable for certain ports). Considerations need to be made in a professional or corporate setting on associated risks.
> 
> [Firewall Setup â€” Syncthing documentation](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/firewall.html#firewall-setup)

- "Add Remote Device"
	- ![450](_attachments/Syncthing%20for%20Obsidian%20Notes/IMG-20240427131720262.png)

- Select the ID of the associated mobile device (assuming you're on the same LAN)
	- ![](_attachments/Syncthing%20for%20Obsidian%20Notes/IMG-20240427131720304.png)

- If you aren't on the same network, then obtain the ID from mobile Syncthing.  Device ID does not need to be kept secret .[^1]
![300](_attachments/Syncthing%20for%20Obsidian%20Notes/IMG-20240427131720353.png)

- On the mobile device or other client, follow the same process
	- On mobile

	- Clicked button to use camera with QR code
	- On PC, opened up identification

# Syncing Obsidian Vault to Other Clients (PC to Mobile)
- On PC > Syncthing Web UI > "Add Folder"
	- General
		- Name the folder label
		- Use a folder ID that will be used on all cluster devices
		- Copy and paste the folder path of the applicable existing Obsidian vault
		- Ignore the quote I put at the end accidentally
			- ![](_attachments/Syncthing%20for%20Obsidian%20Notes/IMG-20240427131720473.png)
	- Sharing
		- Select clients you want to sync to, add a password if you need to.
	- Advanced
		- [ ] Figure out what advanced sharing options to use with - extended attributes? âž• 2024-04-26
		- You can begin as "send only" at first, then switch it up once things have been synced just to be safe
		- ![](_attachments/Syncthing%20for%20Obsidian%20Notes/IMG-20240427131720519.png)

- To set up mobile, set up a folder and use the same exact "Folder ID"

# Issues and Limitations?
- [Obsidian + Syncthing = Killer Combination](https://deepakness.com/blog/obsidian-syncthing/)

> [!quote] I have decided to subscribe toÂ [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync)Â which is $5 per month (if billed monthly).
> 
> While Obsidian + Syncthing works great, I started to have some issues with it.
> 
> The issue is, both your devices need to be connected to the same wifi network otherwise the changes will not sync immediately. Plus, the Syncthing mobile app keeps always running in the background and drains the battery fast.
> 
> Also, if you make some changes in a note from one device and then again make some changes from the other device without letting Syncthing sync the first change, there will be conflicts in syncing. And, you will have to resolve it manually every single time.
> 
> For my use case, it wasnâ€™t working efficiently and thatâ€™s why I decided to get Obsidian Sync.
> 
> However, if all your devices are always connected to the same network, you can keep using the Obsidian and Syncthing setup.

- If it's true that you have to be on the same LAN, then this might be a deal breaker
