## hardware equipment

### Equipment type

### Wireless Router

Our most common wireless router (SOHO wireless router) actually not only includes the function of a router, but integrates multiple functions such as a router, a firewall, a switch, and a wireless AP. The operation and setting are relatively simple and can meet the needs of most families.

- [Wireless router - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_router)

### Wireless mesh system/distributed routing

When a single wireless router cannot meet the coverage area, multiple devices can be networked to expand the wireless area. Multiple nodes of the wireless mesh system can communicate with each other to form a mesh network, and automatically select the best path during communication. At present, a large number of manufacturers have launched wireless mesh systems for home use.

- [Wireless mesh network - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network)

### Wireless AP

Wireless APs generally only provide Wi-Fi access functions, and need to cooperate with switches and routers to build a complete wireless network. Compared with the home wireless mesh system, the networking of multiple wireless APs has advantages in terms of stability, speed, and coverage area. The disadvantage is that the installation is complicated, and it is mainly used in enterprises. When it is used in the home, it generally needs to be considered in the initial stage of decoration.

- [Wireless Access Point - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]([https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/無線接��](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%84%A1%E7%B7%9A%E6%8E%A5%E5%85) %A5%E9%BB%9E)

### switch

Switches work at the data link layer and can connect multiple devices within the same network. For example, there are multiple computers, game consoles and other devices at home, but the number of network ports on the ordinary wireless router is insufficient, you can use a switch to expand the network ports to connect multiple devices.

- [Network switch - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]([https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/網路交換](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E4%BA%A4%E6%8F%9B) %E5%99%A8)

### Wired Router

Routers work at the network layer and are used to connect two or more networks and forward data between multiple networks. For home scenarios, routers are generally used to connect operator networks and home networks, and are responsible for allowing devices at home to access the Internet.

When ordinary wireless routers cannot meet the needs, you can use more powerful wired routers, combined with switches and wireless APs, to build a home network.

- [Router - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B7%AF%E7%94%B1%E5%99%A8)

### Soft Routing

Soft routers generally use general-purpose hardware platforms, such as routers built on x86 servers. Compared with ordinary routers, special hardware is rarely used to accelerate functions such as message forwarding, but it is processed in the form of pure software.

Since the soft router uses general-purpose hardware, has a large memory, and mostly runs an operating system based on Linux or FreeBSD, it can expand more functions through software and has greater flexibility. In terms of performance, soft routers have more powerful CPUs, but ordinary routers can implement routing forwarding, QoS, NAT and other functions through specialized hardware, so simple comparisons cannot be made.

- [From hearing to getting started, a soft routing entry guide that everyone can understand - Minority](https://sspai.com/post/58628)
- [OpenWrt (with soft routing) concise tutorial](https://larrywonss.github.io/)

### light cat

Optical cats are used to convert optical signals into electrical signals. At present, most household optical modems also have the functions of routing and Wi-Fi.

Optical modems are generally provided by operators and rented when broadband is installed. Some users who are pursuing the Internet will also choose to purchase by themselves, but different regions have different requirements for optical modems, and the setting methods are not necessarily the same, so you need to understand relevant information before purchasing.

In addition, there are hardware such as PON Stick, which integrates optical modems into SFP+ modules, and can be directly used with routers or switches that support SFP+ interfaces, reducing the volume occupation.

- [Dual-mode PON STICK ONU SFP-Shenzhen Natywish Technology Co., Ltd.](http://www.natywish.com/product/detail/219.html)

### Development Board

At present, there are many development boards on the market, with single or multiple network ports, running standard Linux or OpenWrt, and some even support Wi-Fi, which can realize the following functions:

- The performance of most development boards of self-made wireless routers may not be sufficient, or there is only one network port, and not many people do this
- Using some home wireless routers as DNS server, proxy server, HomeBridge/HomeAssistant server, etc. can also realize these functions by installing software. However, considering performance and stability, it is a better choice to run related services through an independent development board
- Connect sensors, display screens, relays, etc. to realize IoT and smart home related functions Most development boards have rich IO port resources and can connect more modules to realize IoT related functions

Common development boards with network functions are as follows:

- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and other popular single-board computers, you can find a lot of resources on the Internet

### Enterprise Class Devices

For network enthusiasts, you can also consider enterprise-level network equipment, such as Aruba, Ruckus, CISCO, or equipment from domestic manufacturers such as Huawei, H3C, and Ruijie.

Since this List mainly focuses on home networks, it will not organize too much knowledge about enterprise-level devices.

### other

In addition to routers, switches and other devices, there are many auxiliary devices on the market to enhance the functions of the home network.

### Linksys Linksys

Linksys was founded in 1988 and was later acquired by CISCO. But in 2013 CISCO sold Linysys to Belkin.

Among them, Linksys' WRT54G is a home wireless router that used Linux earlier in history, so its firmware needs to be open source according to the GPL agreement. Many enthusiasts have modified and added functions based on the open source firmware of WRT54G. The well-known open source router operating systems OpenWrt, DD-Wrt, etc., all have more or less certain origins with WRT54G.

At present, Linksys still has many competitive products, such as the mesho system Velop.

### Phicom

It is well known by everyone because of the "0 yuan purchase" model. Common models are K2P, K3C and K3. At present, it can be bought at a lower price on some second-hand trading platforms.

The overall configuration and workmanship of Phicomm routers are good, and many people have adapted open source firmware for it. However, you need to pay attention to the difference between different versions of hardware when purchasing, such as version A and version B of K2P; models such as K3 may need to modify the hardware by yourself to avoid problems such as "oil leakage". If you like to toss, you can buy it when the second-hand price is relatively low.

### Tenda

Domestic wireless router brand, the price is relatively low, and some models can flash OpenWrt.

- [Tenda Official Website](https://www.tenda.com.cn/)

### Millet

Xiaomi routers are developed using the "Internet model". The official firmware provides a wealth of functions (such as launching remote downloads in cooperation with Thunder), and the UI is relatively more modern and beautiful. But at the same time, there are also problems such as hijacking "404 page hijacking".

- [Xiaomi Router Official Website](http://www.miwifi.com/)
- [The story of Xiaomi router hijacking users' browsers](https://www.infoq.cn/article/2015/06/xiaom-hijack)
- [How do you view the 404 webpage hijacking of Xiaomi routing?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/30358197)

However, most models of Xiaomi routers without hard drives can better support OpenWrt, Padavan and other systems; they have certain advantages in industrial design, hardware configuration, and cost performance. Consider using third-party systems after purchase.

Xiaomi's recently launched Wi-Fi 6 series routers have improved in software and gained a better reputation. At the same time, the latest version of the firmware starts to support running third-party software through Docker:

- [Introduction to Docker Functions of Xiaomi Router AX9000 Developer Version - Xiaomi Community](https://www.xiaomi.cn/post/32988534)

### Huawei, Honor

Huawei's original business mainly focused on operator networks, and it launched home wireless routers late.

The main features include support for the HiLink smart home platform, and some models use self-developed chips. However, the use of self-developed new products also brings certain difficulties to support systems such as OpenWrt.

Since there are many models of Huawei and Honor home routers, the differences between different models are large, and the specific functions, performance, stability, etc., it is recommended to search online to understand and judge by yourself before purchasing.

- [Honor Home Router Official Website]([https://ww](https://ww/)[w.honor.cn/products/home-internet-media/](http://w.honor.cn/products/home-internet-media/))

### H3C H3C

H3C's original business mainly focused on enterprise networks, and launched home wireless routers later.

According to official promotional materials, H3C home routers use the MINIWARE operating system (the same name as the operating system used by some of H3C's commercial wireless APs), and support security functions such as IPS. The system mainly focuses on basic network functions, the interface is relatively simple, and the functions are not as rich as the home routers of Internet manufacturers. But it also theoretically guarantees a certain degree of stability. The industrial design of the Magic B1 and other models on the hardware is quite unique.

In addition to wireless routers and mesh systems, its product line also includes household AC+AP sets, etc. No third-party systems such as OpenWrt have been found so far.

### D-Link

Network equipment brand, providing routers, switches, wireless network cards and other equipment.

- [Dlink official website](http://www.dlink.com.cn/)

###360

Home routers developed in the "Internet mode" are sold with "security" features. However, its marketing concepts such as "pregnant woman mode" have been disgusted by many people.

- [360 Home Router Official Website](https://luyou.360.cn/)
- [How to evaluate the "pregnant woman mode" of 360 security router?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/31207364)

### Synology

NAS manufacturers entered the field of wireless routers late. At present, three products are launched: RT1900ac, RT2600ac, and mesh router MR2200ac. It features its own Synology Router Manager (SRM) operating system.

SRM is based on Synology's NAS operating system [DSM](https://www.synology.com/zh-cn/dsm), which has a friendly user interface and has certain NAS functions after connecting an external hard disk. And supports [File Station](https://www.synology.com/en-us/knowledgebase/DSM/help/FileStation/FileBrowser_desc), [Download Station]([https://www.synology.com](https://www.synology.com/) /zh-cn/knowledgebase/DSM/help/DownloadStation/DownloadStation_desc), [Media Server](https://www.synology.com/zh-cn/knowledgebase/DSM/help/MediaServer/application_mediaserver_desc) three software.

SRM is more active in the application of new technologies, such as WPA3, DNS over HTTPS, etc. The parental control/access control features on SRM, as well as the Suricata-based IPS feature, are among the best in its class.

In addition, SRM has the function of installing third-party software to a certain extent. Some DSM software has been modified to run on the SRM. It is also possible to install optware/entware on the SRM, and install more software through the `opkg` command.

However, as a new manufacturer of home routers, Synology has insufficient experience in software development and release processes. I have encountered a situation where multiple versions were released on the same day to completely solve a problem, and the new version caused the previously set scheduled tasks to be invalid and needed to be reset (refer to [this link]([https://www.synology.com](https://www.synology.com/) /en-uk/releaseNote/RT2600ac), as described in version 1.2.3-8017-4). In addition, in the process of personal use, I have also encountered the problem that the network is unstable and can only be recovered after restarting the router.

### Ubiquiti

A network equipment manufacturer whose founder is a hardware engineer for the Apple AirPort series. Its UniFi series provides commercial Wi-Fi systems with low prices (compared to CISCO, Aruba, and Ruckus), and is also favored by some personal/home users because of its industrial design and ease of use. Subsequent Ubiquiti Labs also launched the AmpliFi series of home products.

In addition, Ubiquiti's products are excellent in the user interface and user experience of the software (web interface and mobile app), and can also support Dark Mode in the first place.

- Mesh between different types of equipment Some manufacturers' different types of equipment can be used for mesh networking, so that old equipment can be fully utilized and costs can be saved. A typical example is AiMesh from ASUS.
    - [AiMesh](https://www.asus.com/Microsite/AiMesh/cn/)
- Mesh between devices from different manufacturers
    - [EasyMesh](https://www.wi-fi.org/zh-hans/discover-wi-fi/wi-fi-easymesh) is a standard developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance, which aims to make devices from different manufacturers interoperable , Devices certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance EasyMesh can work together to form a network. As a relatively new technical standard, there are not many supported devices at present. The manufacturers concerned in China mainly include Huawei, ZTE, Fiberhome, and D-Link.
- Wired backhaul Most manufacturers' wireless mesh systems support wired backhaul. That is, the communication between mesh nodes is carried out by wire, which further increases bandwidth and stability. Definitely requires re-complicated wiring work.
    - [Mesh Router Wired Backhaul Wiring Solution](https://xoyozo.net/Blog/Details/mesh-wired-backhaul#)
- The high-end wireless router models of some tri-band mesh manufacturers have an independent 5GHz frequency band, which is used for communication between mesh nodes and does not occupy the frequency band for communication between wireless routers and terminals. Doing so can also improve bandwidth and stability to a certain extent, and reduce the trouble caused by wiring.

### Wired Router + AC + AP

Through the way of wired router + AC + AP, the best speed and stability can be guaranteed. However, such a solution requires more complicated wiring and is generally used in enterprises, hotels, shopping malls and other places. Home use needs to be considered before decoration.

The AC + AP solutions of most manufacturers are not for home use, and the general configuration is more complicated. However, manufacturers such as TP-LINK and H3C have also launched home AP sets, which integrate the router and AC into a single device, which can be directly placed in a weak current box to save space.

In addition, Ubiquiti's wireless AP solution is also loved by some home users because it does not require an AC, is simple to configure, and has a friendly graphical interface.

In addition to being placed on desktops and cabinets, wireless APs can also be panel-mounted or ceiling-mounted, so as to better integrate into the decoration style and save space.

### One-arm routing

For devices with only one network port (such as ordinary home computers, Intel NUC, Raspberry Pi development boards, etc.), if you want to use it as a router, you can use one-arm routing to achieve it.

One-arm routing is equivalent to creating multiple sub-interfaces on an interface, and different sub-interfaces correspond to different VLANs, so that one interface can be used as multiple interfaces.

## Technical concepts

### MU-MIMO

MU-MIMO is a feature added in 802.11ac Wave 2, which enables multiple devices to communicate with the wireless router at the same time, improving wireless utilization efficiency and throughput.

However, MU-MIMO requires the support of terminal equipment and has many limitations. Currently, the improvement of network experience is not obvious.

In Wi-Fi 6, MU-MIMO has been enhanced and may become more practical as Wi-Fi 6 becomes more popular.

### PA/LNA/Amplifier

When reading router reviews and product introduction pages, you often see concepts such as PA and LNA. Among them, PA is a power amplifier, which is used to enhance the power of the transmitted signal, and LNA is a low noise amplifier, which is used to enhance the received signal.

A wireless router/AP with a PA/LNA for better signal.

## Software and hardware functions

### UPnP/NAT-PMP/Port Mapping

When the router accesses the Internet through home broadband, the operator will assign it an IP address. However, there will be various devices such as computers and mobile phones in the family, and multiple devices need to access the Internet. At this time, the router assigns an intranet IP to each device, and accesses the Internet through network address translation (NAT).

However, through NAT, devices in the intranet can only actively initiate external connections, but cannot act as servers to receive external connections. In this case, it will become more difficult to access devices such as NAS at home from the outside, and remotely control computers at home. At the same time, the upload and download speeds of P2P sharing tools such as BT and eMule will also be affected, and the connection quality of some voice/video call tools may also be affected.

For this situation, port mapping can be used to map the port of the internal network device to the public network to achieve external access. Most home routers support manual configuration of port mapping, and also support automatic port mapping through UPnP/NAT-PMP.

- [P2P network core technology: UPnP and SSDP protocols](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/40407669)
- [NAT Port Mapping Protocol - Wikipedia]([https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/NAT端口映射](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/NAT%E7%AB%AF%E5%8F%A3%E6%98%A0%E5%B0%84) %E5%8D%8F%E8%AE%AE)
- [RFC6886 - NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6886)

### DDNS

DDNS is also a common function that most home routers will have. Since the public network IP of the home broadband is not fixed, every time the router is restarted, a new IP address may be obtained. Through DDNS, devices in the home network can be accessed from the outside through a fixed domain name.

- [Dynamic DNS - Wikipedia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E5%8B%95%E6%85%8BDNS)
- [DDNS Simple Tutorial](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/46580280)

### Traffic shaping and QoS

In household scenarios, some applications require relatively high bandwidth but are not sensitive to delay (such as online video, P2P download, etc.); some applications do not require high bandwidth but are sensitive to delay (such as online games, voice/video calls, etc.) ).

At home, P2P downloads often occupy a large bandwidth, which affects the smoothness of online games, audio and video calls and other applications, and even normal web browsing will slow down. This problem can be solved by QoS.

Most mid-to-high-end home routers provide QoS function, which can manually set the priority of different devices and different applications, such as increasing the priority of a certain game or a game console at home.

In addition, algorithms such as fq_codel and CAKE have gradually been applied on home routers, which can intelligently manage traffic without complex configuration. This feature is called SQM in OpenWrt, and options such as "Smart QoS" and "Smart Queue" in other router firmware generally refer to this feature.

### Captive Portal

Captive Portal provides a webpage authentication page, and the password can be entered in the webpage to access the network.

In the home network, Captive Portal is often used in the guest network. Visitors need to enter the password in the web page to connect, preventing the Wi-Fi password from being leaked by software such as "Wi-Fi Master Key". At the same time, you can also add usage instructions, disclaimers and other content on the Portal page, and the user can only connect after agreeing; if it is used in a store, you can also use the Portal page to place advertisements.

The Captive Portal function is commonly found in commercial and enterprise-level devices, and not many home routers support this function. For open source systems such as OpenWrt, tools such as WiFiDog can be used to implement Captive Portal.

### Intranet Penetration

Due to limited IPv4 address resources, some operators will not allocate public network IPv4 addresses to home broadband users. At this time, if you need to access services in the home network, you need the intranet penetration function.

There are two common intranet penetration methods, one is to transfer through the server, but generally you need to purchase a VPS server and set up the environment yourself. Or buy a dedicated business service.

The other is through NAT hole punching. The advantage of this method is that the devices can communicate directly, avoiding the consumption of server traffic, and improving the speed to a certain extent. The disadvantage is that NAT hole punching generally uses the UDP protocol, and the speed may be limited by some ISPs in the case of large traffic.

### Parental Controls

The parental control function can control the online time of specific devices to prevent children from spending too much time online.

The parental control function of some routers can also restrict devices from accessing inappropriate websites, and at the same time forcibly open Google Search and YouTube’s safe search functions to prevent children from being exposed to inappropriate content.

And Synology Safe Access provides more powerful parental control. In addition to controlling the duration of the Internet and restricting access to content, it also has powerful analysis and statistics functions, which can analyze the Internet habits of different people in the family based on statistical information.

- [ASUS AiProtection](https://www.asus.com.cn/AiProtection/)
- [eero Secure](https://eero.com/shop/eero-secure)

### Content filtering

Through the content filtering function, you can filter malicious advertisements, malicious websites, trackers, adult websites and other content according to the rules to protect security and privacy and obtain a better online experience. At the same time, it can be combined with parental control to restrict minors from accessing content that is not suitable for the current age.

- Legal/moral issues of advertising filtering Some people believe that it is the user's freedom to choose whether to filter advertising; some people believe that advertising filtering will have an adverse impact on the Internet ecology. Regarding whether advertisement filtering should be performed, please refer to discussions on the Internet.

### IPS/IDS

The IPS/IDS function records and blocks packets with security risks by analyzing the contents of the packets to improve the security of the home network. Compared with other domain name/DNS based schemes, IPS/IDS can identify more security threats, but also consumes more CPU and memory resources.

The common open source IPS/IDS software includes Snort and Suricata, and the official firmware of some routers also provides IPS/IDS functions.

- [Norton Core Router](https://us.norton.com/core)

### Traffic Statistics/DPI

The traffic statistics function can analyze and count the traffic usage of each device in the network. However, due to the need to occupy CPU and storage resources, some low-end routers do not have this function.

Some routers have DPI-based traffic statistics. In addition to counting the traffic usage of each device, it can also count the traffic of each application, thereby providing more detailed traffic statistics.

For open source systems, tools such as ntopng can be used to implement traffic statistics:

- [ntopng – ntop](https://www.ntop.org/products/traffic-analysis/ntop/)

### Multiple WAN ports, multiple dialing

Some routers have multiple WAN ports, which can be connected to multiple broadband to realize bandwidth superposition. And realize switching to another broadband when one broadband fails.

In addition, there is a router that can connect to an LTE network card through a USB interface, or use the USB network sharing function of Android and iOS to achieve Internet backup using a 4G/LTE link when broadband fails.

For systems such as OpenWrt and RouterOS, multiple PPPoE sessions can also be established on one WAN port to achieve "single-line multi-dial" and increase bandwidth. However, some operators do not support multi-dial. For details, please refer to the agreement signed with the operator when applying for broadband.

### Bandwidth Boost

Some routers claim to have the function of "enhancing physical bandwidth", which is actually achieved through cooperation with operators. Operators can dynamically adjust the bandwidth limit and automatically increase the bandwidth after payment.

"Xunlei Kuaibird" is a relatively well-known network acceleration service. At the same time, a third-party developer has ported it to the router, which can easily open the speed-up service on the router.

### Game Acceleration

Game acceleration is also a major selling point of many home wireless routers. Generally, it is achieved by increasing the QoS priority of the game. At the same time, it has built-in services such as "Netease UU Accelerator", and connects to a higher-quality network through a proxy server provided by a third party to achieve online game acceleration.

    ### Run third-party applications
    
    Many router operating systems can run third-party applications in a certain way, expand the functions of the router, and make the router more "smart".
    
    - Package management system Like many Linux/UNIX distributions, some Linux/UNIX-based router operating systems also have their own package management systems.
        - [OpenWrt's Opkg Package Manager](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/additional-software/opkg) OpenWrt completely uses Opkg as its package management system, the entire system, including kernel modules and drivers, Both are managed by Opkg.
        - [pfSense's package management system](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/packages/package-manager.html) pfSense is based on FreeBSD, in addition to installing pfSense's own software packages, you can also easily Install the FreeBSD package.
    - Software Center Many router operating systems have a software center with a graphical interface, which can easily add software in a graphical way. However, there are also some routers, such as some models of TP-LINK, whose "software center" is just a series of switches for built-in functions, and it is impossible to install third-party software to expand functions.
        - [KoolCenter Software Center](https://www.koolcenter.com/posts/55) comes from the software center of KoolCenter (formerly KoolShare Forum), which mainly supports Asuswrt-Merlin and provides special software suitable for domestic users.
        - [Synology SRM Package Center](https://www.synology.com/en-us/srm/packages) The software center that comes with the Synology Router Manager (SRM) operating system, currently only has a small amount of software from Synology. But some software from Synology DSM, after modification, can also be manually installed in SRM Software Center.
    - Entware/Optware Many router operating systems, such as Asuswrt-Merlin, DD-WRT, Synology Router Manager, etc., do not support the installation of third-party software by default, or have limited support for third-party software, which can be installed through Entware/Optware software.

        - [Installing Entware - DD-WRT Wiki](https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Installing_Entware)
    - Because docker partially supports the router operating system of Docker, it can also run containers through Docker to run third-party software.
        - [Persistent PiHole via Docker on UDMPro : Ubiquiti](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/dvik8g/persistent_pihole_via_docker_on_udmpro/)
    
    ### Virtualization
    
    Some router operating systems have certain virtualization functions, and can run other containers or operating systems in the router.
    
    A common application that utilizes the Metarouter function of RouterOS to run OpenWrt, and realize the characteristic functions of using RouterOS and OpenWrt on one device at the same time.

    - [RouterOS Metarouter](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Metarouter): A lightweight virtual router that can run RouterOS, OpenWrt and other systems
    
    ### Mobile App
    
    Many of the current mainstream home routers support the use of mobile apps for control. But for some of the more popular open source router operating systems, some third-party developers will develop apps for them.
    
    The quality and security of these third-party apps may not be guaranteed. Before using them, you need to have a preliminary understanding of the app's functions, authors, and open source status.

    ###SNMP
    
    A small number of home router operating systems (such as Synology Router Manager), and most commercial/enterprise-class network devices support SNMP. Through the SNMP protocol, centralized management and monitoring of devices can be realized (for example, using Cacti to collect traffic statistics).

    ### Network storage, media center
    
    There are many routers with USB ports, which can be connected to USB mobile hard disks to realize functions such as network storage.
    
    In addition, there are also wireless routers with SATA interface and M.2 interface, which can directly install the hard disk into the router, and the appearance is more compact:
    
    - [Xiaomi Router HD](http://www.mi.com/miwifihd): hard disk with built-in SATA interface
    - [ASUS BRT-AC828](https://www.asus.com/Business-Networking/BRT-AC828/): Built-in M.2 interface, can install SSD with M.2 interface
    
    In terms of function, after connecting the hard disk, the wireless router completes the following tasks:
    
    - File sharing via protocols such as SMB/AFP/NFS

### Bonjour/mDNS

Through the Bonjour function, Apple devices can directly access the router through the `.local` domain name, without having to remember complex IP addresses.

In addition to Apple devices, there are currently many smart home devices (such as Mijia's Wi-Fi devices), as well as Chromecast, etc., have also begun to use the Bonjour protocol. If the home network is complex (for example, there are multiple subnets/multiple VLANs), you can use the Bonjour gateway function to realize device discovery through Bonjour between multiple networks.

### Campus Network

The campus networks of different schools have different authentication methods, and some schools also use private protocols. For the campus network, it is recommended to find out whether the school’s campus network can be connected and authenticated on devices such as OpenWrt in communities such as school forums.

### Official Firmware vs Modified Firmware

There are quite a few people and many organizations who will make modifications based on open source systems such as OpenWrt, Padavan, Asuswrt-Merlin, or official firmware from some manufacturers, so that they conform to the usage habits of more people.

Generally speaking, in terms of security, it is the safest to use officially released firmware, or compile it yourself based on open source code. The quality of the modified firmware is uneven, which may solve some security problems in the official firmware, but may introduce new security risks. In terms of security, a simple judgment can be made from the following points:

- Whether the modified firmware is open source The modified firmware remains open source, which is beneficial for users to ensure that relevant modifications do not introduce security vulnerabilities by checking the source code and other methods. For example, [coolsnowwolf/lede](notion://www.notion.so/coolsnowwolf/lede) has released the modified source code based on OpenWrt on GitHub.
- Familiarity/number of users of the modified firmware. If the modified firmware has a large number of users, if there are security holes, it will help to be discovered and exposed faster. This facilitates timely repairs.
- Is the modified firmware released in a safe way? If the firmware is downloaded via HTTPS and HASH and GPG signature verification is provided, it will help ensure that the firmware download process is not attacked by man-in-the-middle. However, firmware downloaded through HTTP download, Baidu network disk, etc. may cause the download process to be attacked by a man-in-the-middle, resulting in the download of the replaced firmware.
- Whether the modified version of the firmware follows the main project, and the latest security update of the main project can be synchronized into the main project. You can use the version log, Git commit log, etc. to observe whether the modified version of the firmware follows the main project in a timely manner, and perform security-related updates and modifications.
- Check if the default settings of the modified firmware are safe
    - Whether the firewall rules allow access to services in the router from the outside by default
    - Whether to use insecure protocols (HTTP, telnet, etc.) 10237-1-1.html), it can be seen that the remote Telnet function of the Koolshare Merlin firmware is implemented through the HTTP protocol, which may have security problems. But at present, Koolshare lshare Merlin firmware has adopted other methods to achieve remote login)
    - Whether the system update, software center and other functions are downloaded using an insecure protocol, and signature verification is not performed. Generally speaking, the system update or software center and other functions need to implement HTTPS download or signature verification to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks. Koolshare software center [the old version used the HTTP method] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20190814205504/http://koolshare.cn/thread-60134-1-1.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20190814205504/http://koolshare.cn/thread-60134-1-1.html)) to download, but it has been in time repair.
    - Some relatively small functions, it is recommended to use after evaluating the security risks
        - For example, if there is a function that needs to be decrypted through HTTPS, it can only be used after installing the certificate on the computer
        - Or is there a file sharing feature using unencrypted protocols like FTP, HTTP WebDAV
    
    ### Software update
    
    Manufacturers and firmware developers can fix security vulnerabilities through software updates and other methods. When choosing firmware, you need to consider whether the firmware is updated securely in a timely manner and whether it is updated in a secure manner.
    
    - For commercial firmware/closed source firmware
        - Confirm whether to use encryption or signature verification during automatic update
        - From the update log, observe whether the software update is timely and whether there are security holes
        - In [CVE List](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html), [National Information Security Vulnerability Sharing Platform]([https://www.cnvd.org.cn/flaw/list.htm](https://www.cnvd.org.cn/flaw/list.htm) ?flag=true) and other websites to search and investigate, and observe whether the relevant vulnerabilities are repaired in time
    - For open source firmware, some open source firmware does not include an automatic update function, and you need to pay attention to its software updates in a certain way. The main way to concentrate is as follows.
        - Regularly pay attention to the Release Notes of the system
        - Subscribe to the mailing list of open source projects to get information about security updates by email
        - Watch the corresponding open source project in GitHub, and receive notifications of project updates in time
    
    ### Application of Linux Security Features
    
    Many home routers do not apply the security features already provided by the Linux kernel such as [ALSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization). It must be worn on the belt to weaken the security of the device.

    ### WPA3
    
    WPA3 is a new Wi-Fi security protocol that improves some of WPA2's security weaknesses.
    
    At the same time, WPA3 supports Wi-Fi Enhanced Open mode, which provides an encryption mechanism for open, password-free Wi-Fi networks, which enhances security to a certain extent, and is suitable for Wi-Fi networks in public places such as libraries and shopping malls.
    
    Currently, a small number of wireless routers support WPA3. In addition, some wireless routers (such as Synology RT2600ac) and terminal devices (such as iPhone) have supported WPA3 through software updates.

    ## Operators
    
    ### Carrier Selection
    
    Different regions and different operators have great differences in network quality. If there is a high demand for network quality, it is recommended to know the situation of the local operator in advance.
    
    In addition, operators in some regions also provide services such as "International Boutique Network", which can speed up access to foreign websites.

    ### Acquisition of public network IP and IPv6 address
    
    At present, IPv6 is becoming popular in China, and more and more operators are beginning to allocate IPv6 addresses, which can be allocated after setting up routers.
    
    However, IPv4 address resources are even more scarce, and many areas have been unable to obtain public network IPv4 addresses.
    
    If the IPv6 address cannot be obtained, or there is no public network IPv4 address, you can try to call the operator's customer service number to apply for a public network IP or IPv6 address. However, due to limited IPv4 address resources, even if you call customer service, you may not be able to apply for a public network IP.
    
    In addition, some areas can obtain public network IP through a special user name, or through paid purchases.

    ### Change optical modem to bridge, use router to dial
    
    In the case of insufficient NAT performance of the optical modem, the optical modem can be modified to bridge mode, and the router can be used to dial up to improve performance.
    
    In most areas, you can call the operator and ask the operator to remotely modify the optical modem to bridge mode. You can also find or crack the super password of the optical modem on the Internet according to the model of the optical modem, and modify it to bridge mode in the management page.
    
    However, for gigabit broadband in some areas, after the optical modem is replaced with a bridge, the bandwidth will decrease instead.

    ## Common Misunderstandings, Q&A
    
    ### The terminal only supports 2x2 MIMO, there is no need to choose a wireless router with 3x3 MIMO or 4x4 MIMO?
    
    At present, most mobile devices only support 1x1 MIMO or 2x2 MIMO, but many high-end home routers already support 4x4 MIMO. Many people think that it is not necessary to choose a wireless router with 4x4 MIMO.
    
    But in fact, the radio transmission power of routers and terminals is fixed, and wireless routers that support 4x4 MIMO can receive and send the same data through multiple antennas to improve throughput and Wi-Fi coverage.
