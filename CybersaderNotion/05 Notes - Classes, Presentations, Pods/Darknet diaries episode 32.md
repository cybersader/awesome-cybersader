- Most credit cards in PayPal and not accepted to pay for things on the dark web
- Everything's linked to identifying information
- Western Union is a doable place for crime but it's not instant
- Bitcoin wasn't used widely in 2007 so Liberty reserve was the best option
- Liberty reserve is a lot like PayPal but they don't require a lot of identifying information
- Vending is all done with trust on the dark web and with payment cards it revolves around validity rates
- The secret service is a big defender of financial fraud not to mention also protecting the president and their families
- Ncux was very popular at one point
- Carding world was another popular forum
- Ncux was translated to seek in Russian
- Carder su was popular
- Track 2 was one popular user that showed up
- All of the sudden this new user was a trusted user which was a title that was hard to get. It was also noticed that other vendors started dropping off the site at the same time
- There were to investigations that were linked to each other based on malware at a deli store and payment cards being used illegally

- The BECU or Boeing engineers credit Union was reporting fraudulent usage of credit cards
- Kameo malware was used on machines at Capitol Hill in Seattle and the investigator happened to be there so he went and forensicated the machines
- This was loaded onto credit card machines
- The initial exploitation was done by browsing to a website and downloading malware which likely meant there was physical access
- They looked through the email after it was finally provided and found PayPal
- PayPal requires you to provide actual identification and verification so they linked it back to Roman solevsky who was the same person from NCUX
- It seems that the FSB from Russia had tipped him off and so he covered his tracks into his old aliases
- They had also been renting a server from Hop One in Virginia and so it weren't was obtained
- It looked like the initial access was not physical access and rather exploiting public facing RDP
- The process went like this: search the web for public facing RDP on Windows, see if there's credit card processing software, load Kameo onto it, if the credit cards and payment card info, and move it to his server.

- In 2013 the IRS, FTC, and the secret service were all fed up with Liberty reserve so they decided to take them down
- They arrested the owner and took down the company which was based in Costa Rica
- Roman was still avoiding the extradition treaty companies but the secret service managed to convince the Maldives to expel him and therefore the secret service would be able to capture him

- Roman had terrible opsec
- The investigators looked through slackspace in the drives and also volume shadow copies
- Roman's father talked to him about paying off prosecutors with millions of dollars
- Most of these restaurants and even zoos had already pee open to the public so that they could do IT support. They reused passwords because they operated with a lot of businesses
