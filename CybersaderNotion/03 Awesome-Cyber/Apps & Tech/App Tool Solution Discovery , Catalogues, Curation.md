# The Business Model Matters

Make sure that you know how the monetary model works before going and using some software.

## Open-Source vs Proprietary

The good part about open-source is that you can gauge how much work is actually put in.

Common Issues in Proprietary:

- It looks like “magic”, but it really isn’t that special
- Sometimes the product just visually looks good, but lacks effectiveness, viability, and functionality.
    - The GUI just looks good
    - The website just looks good
- Not enough detail to effectively compare to other products

# Research-Based | Professional | Consultants

Here you can be sure that the results can usually be good because the monetary model makes it so that the business doesn’t have to solve the researching problem in weird ways (contributions, mass reviews, etc.).  In theory and hopefully practice, this is a good way to bring knowledge to people.  However, it has the inherent flaw of only providing knowledge to those who have already obtained enough value in their solutions (they have enough money to pay for this research). This means that those solution-makers or businesses that need such knowledge to finalize their solution will sometimes never come to fruition.  It's a dilemma.  To obtain entrance to such knowledge, one must work with what they have available to them.
