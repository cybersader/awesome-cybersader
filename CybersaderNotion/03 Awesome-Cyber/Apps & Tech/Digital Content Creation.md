## Webcasting | Group Livestreams

<aside>
üí° **Multi-streaming** is the practice of simultaneously broadcasting video content to multiple platforms. It allows creators to reach their audience on different platforms, increasing the potential reach and visibility of their content. Multi-streaming can be done through specialized software that allows a single broadcast to be sent to multiple platforms, such as YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and others, at the same time. This can save time for content creators and improve the efficiency of their content distribution.
