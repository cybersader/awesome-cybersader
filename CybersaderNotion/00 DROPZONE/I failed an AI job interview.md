# I failed an AI job interview

https://youtu.be/FllnUBvhoUc?si=QVyomb9RnxUUrKIC

- AI job interviews are rough. These aren't interviews for an AI job but interviews done by AI
- GPT vetting is an example of this
- The vendors are saying that this speeds up the interview process and makes it more gamified.  Gamification in this case is silly
- The gamification is no different from going into your own IDE and changing some colors and things like that
- The most impressive part of this tool is the web-based IDE
- You can mass or bulk upload a CSV to spam a list of candidates. This is disrespectful
- Can you tell me a bit about your experience at blank is a really bad question to ask
- Interviews have changed and job applications are harder for tech jobs like cyber security because more people apply
- Tons of people apply and these IT teams don't really have that much time to look at every single candidate
- They have to entrust these candidates to complex systems and problems and having a interview does not tell you if that person will work well with your team or actually get stuff done
- The hardest thing to come by when hiring is trust.  This is why hiring managers and teams will turn to relationships and networking first when hiring someone because then they're going to somebody they trust
- If they aren't interested in the tech that you're using then they might not have a great time

- It's hard to cut through the bull crap and find the people you actually want and trust
- You have to pull honesty out of the interviewers and get them comfortable first
- You have to figure out their qualified and compatible
- Les Junior rolls exist, more people are getting laid off, and companies are downsizing. This is causing companies to get swarmed with applications every time they post a job
- The company is that build tools like this AI company are trying to solve the problem for engineers that don't want to hire. The real problem should be related to the interviews and the interviewees and the interviewers rather than the teams that don't want to hire.
- Building a faster horse is not the answer. We should be building a wagon
- This is an interviewer problem of resources and time.  Managers need to get better at building teams
- Give candidates an intro paper on options for how the interview can go.  They can pick their route and how to show themselves.
- The traditionalist - classic Microsoft interview
- The pragmatist - give them a problem
- The realist - bring something you're familiar with
- The solution here with AI doing interviews is cutting out the good candidates and creating more problems
