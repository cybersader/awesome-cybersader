# *Roadmap & Mission*

## Mission

This is meant to be an opionated base for technology & tools, workflows, techniques, and general information about various topics in cybersecurity. This is aimed at both professionals and the average person. Search engines have tons of inherent issues in terms of mapping out problem domains such as cybersecurity. It can be hard for people to find innovative and simple solutions to basic problems with everything on the internet competing for the attention of the user. Every company wants you to change your behavior or buy their thing. This knowledgebase is my curation or links, resources, and solutions to cyber problems, and you won’t get any ads here mind you. Although, I don’t hit every area of cyber, I hope that most people from all backgrounds can get value from these resources.

## Roadmap

### Knowledgebase Costs

- Notaku recently limited users to only 40 pages for the lowest price plan, so I will need to refactor the knowledgebase and choose my workflow very carefully.

### Contributions and Categorization

- Contribution workflow for people to easily add to the knowledgebase
    - maybe Git-based
- Knowledge graph backed taxonomy / categorization for pages
    - We need a good way to traverse the knowledge and make it flexible for various backgrounds
- GitHub connection to sync with awesome lists on GitHub
    - makes external contributions helpful to the knowledgebase
