# Webcam Replacement?

I'm currently using a Sony a6500, so there's some key components that need to be present:
- Sony E-mount lens mount
- APS-C sensor compatible

16 - 24mm seems good based on [Camera Field of View Details and Calculator (FoV)](https://www.scantips.com/lights/fieldofview.html#top2) 

## APS-C, E-Mount, Auto-Focus
