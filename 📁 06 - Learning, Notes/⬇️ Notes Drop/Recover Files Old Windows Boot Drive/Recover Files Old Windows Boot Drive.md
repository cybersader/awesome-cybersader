Person: 
- Can I have a boot drive with Windows on it and open user folders to get my files?  Without booting into it I want to access the files and I do have the password for that user

ChatGPT: 
- Yes, you can access files on a Windows boot drive from another computer without booting into the Windows installation on that drive. This is commonly done for data recovery, backups, or when moving files from an old hard drive to a new one. Here's a general approach: 
1. **Connect the Drive to Another Computer:**  You'll need to physically connect the drive to another computer. This can be done by installing the drive internally (if there's space and the interface matches, like SATA) or by using an external hard drive enclosure or a SATA-to-USB adapter. Once connected, the computer should recognize it as an external storage device. 
2. **Accessing the Drive:**  Once the drive is connected, you can browse its contents using the File Explorer in Windows. You'll find the user folders under `Users` in the root directory of the drive (e.g., `D:\Users\[UserName]\` if the drive is recognized as D:). 
3. **Handling Permissions:**  If you're trying to access folders within the `Users` directory of the drive, especially the `Documents`, `Pictures`, `Desktop`, etc., folders of a specific user, you might encounter permission warnings because those folders are protected. Windows will typically ask if you want to permanently gain access to the folder. If you confirm, it will modify the folder's permissions, allowing you to access its contents.
- If you're asked for a password and you have it, you should be able to enter it when prompted. However, usually, when accessing a drive externally like this, Windows relies on file permissions rather than user account passwords. If you're the administrator of the computer you're using to access the drive, you should be able to grant yourself permission to access these files. 
4. **Transferring Files:**  You can then copy or move the files from the external drive to the computer's main drive or another storage device as needed.

Note: This process does not typically require the user password of the Windows installation on the drive being accessed. Permissions are managed through the operating system of the computer to which the drive is currently connected, assuming you have administrative rights on that system.

Remember, it's crucial to handle the drive carefully to avoid data loss, especially if it contains important information. If the drive is failing, it's often best to use data recovery software or consult a professional data recovery service.

Person: 
- So it's only if the user has been encrypted with BitLocker that I won't be able to access it correct?

ChatGPT: 
- Yes, that's correct. If the user's folders or the entire drive are encrypted with BitLocker, you won't be able to access the files simply by connecting the drive to another computer and browsing its contents. BitLocker encryption is designed to protect data by encrypting the entire volume. To access the encrypted data, you would need the following: 
1. **BitLocker Recovery Key or Password:**  This is a unique key generated when BitLocker is first activated. It's crucial to have saved this key in a secure location, such as printing it out, saving it to a file, or storing it in your Microsoft account. 
2. **Unlocking the Drive:**  When you connect a BitLocker-encrypted drive to another Windows system, you should be prompted to enter the BitLocker recovery key or password. Once entered correctly, the drive will be unlocked, and you can access its contents as usual.
- If the drive is not automatically prompting for the BitLocker key, you can go to the Control Panel under "System and Security" > "BitLocker Drive Encryption" to manually unlock the drive using your BitLocker recovery key. 
3. **Drive Ownership:**  Keep in mind, even after unlocking a BitLocker-encrypted drive, you might still need to take ownership or grant yourself permission to access specific files or folders, especially those within the `Users` directory.

If you don't have the BitLocker recovery key or password, accessing the encrypted data is extraordinarily difficult, with few practical options available outside of specialized data recovery services, which may or may not be successful and can be quite expensive.

For non-encrypted drives or files, the process described in the previous messages applies, and you should be able to access your files by connecting the drive to another computer and taking ownership or granting permissions as needed.
