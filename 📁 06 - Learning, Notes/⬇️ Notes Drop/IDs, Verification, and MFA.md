# IDs and MFA
- IDs back then may have relied on a signature for temporary cases
- Large-scale issued IDs relied on things that could not easily be simulated or duplicated and much more on obfuscation due to the limitations of old communication
- ID became essential to align large-scale interests of society since interests are up to the will of the individual
- MFA is a way to verify identity and better for a digital realm which relies on cryptographic mechanisms and establishments in them on certain timescales
- MFA is necessary in the digital world because these fragile mechanisms can be implemented in weak systems and the verification process can be undermined.
