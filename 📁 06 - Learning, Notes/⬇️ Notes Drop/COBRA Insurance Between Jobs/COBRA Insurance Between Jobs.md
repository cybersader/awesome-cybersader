- Super expensive continuation of insurance required by companies - they charge you a lot more to continue coverage
- Job will tell you where to get it with something emailed or mailed to you
- Can be kept for what seems to be up to 18 months

- Does it use the same coverage and companies you had at previous employer or what?
	- [Continuation of Health Coverage (COBRA) | U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/health-plans/cobra) 
	- Yes.  It should be a mere continuation of what was already provided
		- `COBRA generally requires that group health plans sponsored by employers with 20 or more employees in the prior year offer employees and their families the opportunity for a temporary extension of health coverage (called continuation coverage) in certain instances where coverage under the plan would otherwise end.`
