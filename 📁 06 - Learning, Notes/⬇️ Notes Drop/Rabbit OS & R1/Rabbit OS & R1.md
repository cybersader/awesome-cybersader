> [!tldr] I'm addicted to screen too much. This would replace that for parts of my day as an assistant one and integrate with services without APIs. I like the vision. If they refactor a bit and go hard on the LAM stuff, I'm down.

- I'm really excited about this ðŸ˜„
- I've always thought that with the internet and everything connected, the next step to making applications more connected is creating a system that can fuzzily interface between apps. Rabbit OS and the R1 attempt to solve this problem with a LAM (large action model)

- Roadmap
	- ![](_attachments/Rabbit%20OS%20&%20R1/IMG-20240429214552203.png)
- Rabbit as a virtual secretary that's trainable - replacing APIs for integrating apps and services, automating stuff
	- my take
		- The internet these days is interconnected in so many ways
		- The CORE value of something like rabbit is not their hardware or their web app.  
		- It's the ability to replace the need for manually integrating between apps and services with APIs by providing a platform for training agents/rabbits to handle interactions for you by understanding web app semantics language to be able to do stuff for you
	- Rabbit teach mode
		- The vision is good, but it could be extended and more ambitious
		- AI safety of teach mode - slow progression to open to public
		- Whitelisting apps for teach mode
	- Marketplace for taught tasks?
		- Would be cool to have a marketplace where you can buy sets of tasks that people have trained rabbit on
- LAM 1.5
	- learn physical, act digital
	- digital to analog - to physical
- Personalized computing - the future?
	- How to change from just all screens
	- We aren't getting rid of screens and typing but making it easier to do that less
	- The goal is to better communicate technology - think neuralink
- Generative UI
	- Don't replace designers
	- Build a system that adapts to the end user
	- Make interfacing with apps easier
	- Just as teachers meet students where they are at, so could the UI
	- Generative UI is a thoughtful approach to the user-digital interface
