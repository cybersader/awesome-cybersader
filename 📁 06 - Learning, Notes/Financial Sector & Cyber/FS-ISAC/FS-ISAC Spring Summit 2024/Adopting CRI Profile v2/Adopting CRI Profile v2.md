- how do we quantify risk
- They map their own framework back to other frameworks
- They wanted a comprehensive taxonomy to map.  People hate doing all these one off assessments for the regulators
- Too much time on compliance and not enough on defense
- NIST CSF 2.0 resonates but missed some pieces from FFIEC
- CRI profile is a meta framework
- How did Sallie Mae adopt it
    - They used to have to CAT tool
    - They used Tandem with the CAT tool
    - Moved to 2.0 this year
    - They used the affiliated tool Axio
    - Straightforward to walk through questions and automatically maps to the other frameworks
    - Second line does a credible challenge of answers
    - GRC aligned policies with CRI
- Evidenced controls and with a maturity view through CRI - CRI helped them build a control framework
- How hard is it to gather evidence or examples?
    - Depends on how you deal with evidence and what your IA or regulator like to see
- Challenges to adopting, control mapping - implementation
    - It's a spreadsheet, but it's big
    - They are developing a slimmed down version for soon
    - They developed partnerships with innovators to move off of spreadsheets - service now, palo alto networks, axios for SaaS versions
    - These are point in time - how to be continuous
    - From 1st line and 2nd line - first then second
        - Can you show examples of effective evidence?
        - These are just examples
    - 2.0 integrated IT and operations and infrastructure handbook from FFIEC and IT flavored items
- Challenges in implementation
    - Just had to build it and check policies
    - Took two meetings a week for a whole year
    - Just a bunch of from scratch work
    - Cross referencing policies to controls is where the work is
- Replaces the CAT assessment
- 2.0 looks in project management and change management as well
- We need to embrace the new stuff and get relationships with other teams - partner with 2nd line
- There is tiering for different levels
    - There's angst around asset size
    - Asset size is not the best determinant for cyber
    - It's about impact to economy
    - Lower tiers are usually community impact
    - Tier 4 is to customers and contractual 3rd parties
- How to present CRI to the board
    - Number of findings and where we are
    - Start doing year over year with a separate update for the board with more details and in a way that aligns with the exercises
    - Preread like Amazon
- Lots of firm interrogating control effectiveness
- NCUA has taken a lone wolf approach - NCUA may take what's left of the CAT and update it
- Talk to them to become an innovator
- Inherent risk in CRI -be careful with inherent risk - it's like an apple product where you can't get in a break it apart

- Who to contact for innovator stuff?
    - 

- Q&A
    - I hate doing things in big spreadsheets
    - We hate ticking and tying
    - Integrating this with documentation or wikis?
        - Partial vs complete
    - How to map out day to day work for technical teams to these?
    - How easy is it to develop over the CRI framework such as the innovators have done?  What's the licensing?
    - 
- Todos
    - Tool to find stuff in obsidian and map back to framework using AI?
