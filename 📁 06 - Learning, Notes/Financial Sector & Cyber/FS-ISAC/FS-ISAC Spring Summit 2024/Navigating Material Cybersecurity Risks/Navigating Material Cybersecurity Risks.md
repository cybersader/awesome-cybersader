- Cyber risk appetite statement? -  you get no guidance on what to say or what they look for
- What is materiality?
    - Core mission of ciso is to prevent material impact
    - Anything that would impact investors risk investment of the company
    - Anything investors would change portfolio over
    - Do we have process for 8-K incident report?
    - Material risk, incident, threat, weakness
        - Not a lot of externa ld definitions on this
        - What threat scales? Ransomware and scaling ransomware
        - 
- When definitions of materiality don't sync up then it comes up at due diligence issues in class action lawsuits
- Critical is not always material.  Document the difference
- Have CFO define materiality with you.  Business logic should be able to be explained in a class action lawsuit
- 10-k and 8-k
- How many of you want raise your hand no matter what I ask
- Know who will release the 8-k
- What is an 8-k?
- You need a data addressable way to talk about risks

- Situational awareness
- Understand the impact of the data being exposed
- Looking at impact, be able to give large scale maps of data and risk by business unit - data classification is hard though
- Cisos should talk as business partners and not technical advisors
- 8k and 10k disclosures important
    - Lots of these follow an industry template
    - This should actually make sense with what you're doing and how you deploy your controls
- Real world 8-ks
    - Initial report published
    - Then the Amendments - how accurately are you tracking expenses during crisis
    - Does crisis management plan include tracking expenses
    - 
- Assign a scribe during a crisis
- Mitre
    - Preventative initial access controls are common
    - The middle of the mitre attack chain is not thoroughly addressed usually
    - Impact mitigation is important and addressed often
- PRESENTATION - show parts of diagram iteratively
- APIs are popular for initial access vectors
- Situational awareness
    - What does the board want to know for metrics
    - What are the remaining material risks that could impact them and quantify them
    - Make sure you can get the data out of your tools to inform situational awareness up your business to leaders
- Action items
    - Who owns posting an 8-k
    - Roles for material incident team
    - Define materiality with CFO and for the company
    - Map risk register to material framework
    - Develop and exercise 8-k cyber incident plan
    - Raice? - relating to plan
    - Akamai research and stats and fin tech
- FAIR MAN? - cyber siloed definition that can introduce some risk
    - National association of cyber directors materiality
- Read the GAAP principles - CFO probably uses this
- Legal team hesitant to document materiality - discoverable
    - Forensics is sometimes brought in under legal due to discover ability
    - No documentation means negligence
    - No one can say the word “breach” in the company
- Simply, start with documentation of the notification sequence in a wiki or formal policy
- What about private? - under GAAP you have requirement for materiality - just not a hard fast requirement yet - TODO
