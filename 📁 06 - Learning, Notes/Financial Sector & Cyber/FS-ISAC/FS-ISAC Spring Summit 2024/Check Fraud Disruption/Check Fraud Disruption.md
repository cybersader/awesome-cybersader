- Fraud threat disruption team
- What is the volume of checks you'll see
- External resources and data sources - what are they for us? - TODO

- Us checks workflow
- Ingestion of tons of intelligence sources
- Average 10 checks daily
- Enrichment to identify the impacted business line
- SharePoint list is created. Then they reach out to the affect business line
- They would usually call relationship managers to figure out how to contact member

- Actioning compromised items
- It must be done quickly
- Do regular followup on the items within two days
- Make sure accounts are closed
- Our technology and development should be working with fraud to reduce risks for members

- Time and FTE restrictions complicate things when it comes to urgency
- Educate employees on it
- Clients are often unfamiliar with he impact of check Fraud

- Benefits
- Brand protection
- Client retention
- Revenue generation
- Criminal disruption and prosecution
- Hardened target turns threat actors away

- They don't know clients but they can at least information share

- Automation efforts
- PowerShell and Python automating into SharePoint

- Key takeaways and future state
- Loss avoidance
- Automation is a necessity
- Streamline ingestion and processing of the data
- Client attribution is hard - fuzzy attribution with manual adjudication could help - TODO

- Q&A
- Python modules for OCR can help
- You can't just put a stop payment on the check
- How often could attribution and prosecution of the threat actors happen? What does attribution look like?
    - They try to get it mailed to them sometimes
    - They do it digitally usually
    - What information do you get together? Peer group works with law enforcement to figure out what they need and they feed them the data. Sometimes telegram helps.
    - Can we get that check mailed?
- High volume of platforms? - they recycle images so have deduplication for it
- Once routing and account number is out there they can use fake IDs and stuff to social engineer as well. They will try multiple times - replace account and routing quickly
- What about volumes? What about root cause for forgeries?
    - They have templates
- For people paying the bank/CU it's harder when their checks are stolen so they have to reach out to the accounts opened at those banks - lot more automation
- Regulation on funds available so how do I feed the data back in? Most checks and clients are identified. Most checks had not been negotiated yet. They restrict the funds if it goes back into their own bank
- How to get client outreach - persistence and helping them understand the workload. The fraud claim will come back. The part that customers don't like is the monitoring and the process. Skip the bad part by doing this.
- They handoff images with stop payments - usually only a few days to get things done - lots of pestering
- Take this to fraud team - TODO
- Numerous talks on overlap between cybersecurity, fraud team, and development/product - TODO
