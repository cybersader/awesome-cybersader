- FIDO and google
- FIDO alliance - behind passkeys and password independent user auth
- 12 years going now
- FIDO is strong and easy
- Using PKC
- Single gesture, possession based, phishing resistant, authentication
- Offering phishing resistant MFA in a single authenticator
- Most challenges relate to scale - physical keys, embedded authenticator in devices and changing phones
- Password can be socially engineered and easily misused
- People give up on services when they forget their passwords - TODO
- Social engineering gets better with LLMs
- Verification for the authenticator which authenticates to your services - TODO
- Use passkeys everywhere possible where users only have to verify or authenticate with the passkey provider or password manager
- Ask vendors to enable passkeys and add to vendor due diligence - TODO
- Syncable authenticators meet AAL2

- Googles journey
- Sms is not that bad but still bad - still easier than going to all your orgs to fix the passwords - since carrier can handle the sim card
- It's mutual authentication - the key checks that the endpoint is good too - FIDO is mutual
- Passkeys came about because everyone has a phone
- You still have to convince the websites to do it
- Upsell moments on websites are helpful to get users over
- Ways passkeys are stored though? - TODO
- Multiple passkeys can login to same account because of the public key nature
- Get passkeys available to members - TODO
- Recovery and getting back into passkeys ecosystem
    - Picking up a new phone
    - Google and Apple need to solve that
    - Could be face scanning or biometrics
    - They could use mobile drivers licenses as well
    - Hard to do recovery without privacy dilemmas
- Recovery is the hard part for implementation and that's on phone carriers
- 

- Q&A
    - Can password managers help facilitate it?  Password managers become liaisons for services that require them.  Are password managers just liaisons for service that haven't got to modern yet?
        - Passkeys provider
        - They manage sign-in creds
        - 
    - Should we force passkey or password providers to not show users the actual passwords?  We still have pages that require typing in manually and they block auto fill or pasting
    - How are we working with platforms to enable passkeys?
