- What's the stuff we've ignored in security for 10 or 15 years
- What will we continue to ignore?

# Intro

## The Problem

- People continue to ignore the same things and step around the mess
- It's the ecosystem of how we sell solutions and IT security as a problem domain

## What we are covering

- Legacy apps
- Exceptions
- Cloud services
- Developers
- Meeting the minimum
- and more...

# Legacy

- Legacy apps bring in vulns that AI and vuln mgmt couldn't account for
- Get rid of your old stuff and fight the traditional sentiments and excuses
- SaaS applications have legacy all the time - if they aren't innovating, then it has more risk. 

# Exceptions

- Exceptions for management
- Exceptions for legacy
- Exceptions for 3rd party vendors
- Exceptions for anything....."Hard"
    - Especially vulnerabilities that are around a component that was developed by someone who's moved onto another job.
- Let's talk about compensating controls
    - Look into compensating controls.  Can we create specialized signatures for things that are hard to fix.  
    - If we have legacy, then can we put it behind better network controls?

- Just cause there's not a metasploit module, does not mean it isn't critical.
- Customers sometimes try to exclude things from scope when they're critical.
