- Tony Sager - Center for Internet Security
- used to work at the NSA

- Given a job for "COMMSEC"
- We used to have one enemy - the Soviet Union
- Polygraph - my results were so amazing they had me come back again
- Computer Security Design Division
- 3rd assignment in Vulnerability Analyst for Defense
- He loves a hopeless challenge
- Finding flaws is a great job
- Cybersecurity has had many names
- He worked in a nuclear lab - "zero defect" environment - no room for mistakes
- Everything was the first time
	- How do we emulate adversaries
	- How do we pentest
	- How to defend against people with lots of resources and persistence
- Common element - vulnerabilities
- 3 parts to his cyber journey:
	- 1) finding flaws
	- 2) management - see failure at worldwide scale
		- 800 people attack and defense
		- attack engines - seeing how countries hit each other - it's always happening - complex and dynamic
	- 3) what are we doing wrong
		- same problems with every pentest
		- basic flaws in all of the software decades after they were known
		- government could not solve this
		- government can't tell us what to do to fix it
- A look inside NSA defensive mission
	- Systems and Network Attack Center (SNAC)
		- 35 people
		- his boss's philosophy - 50 hacker kids could solve this - be careful what you wish for
			- create a new professional discipline
			- understand flaws so that we can manage the risk
	- Eligible Receiver 97
		- Plan and exercise over an over again
		- IT focused Red Team was used
		- This was a wakeup call executives that exploitation of IT systems could bring the US military to its knees
	- NSA Security Guides (2001)
		- How to configure stuff for the DoD
	- The NSA didn't think anyone working there would one day be doing talks - it happened with media and they wanted to be somewhat transparent
	- Cyber Defense eXercise (2001)
	- The whole Westpoint team showed up at Blackhat
	- Vulnerability Analysis and Operations Group  (VAO)
- What's the role of government in cyber
	- They have to bring content
	- "Let's give them powerpoints and PDFs so they'll fix everything" - it's not good enough to scare people into action - hard lesson
	- Inspire them with cleverness
	- We don't have people become health experts to manage their health risks.
	- They collected and analyzed without showing people how to fix it
	- Other people won't become wizards
- How "bad" is it?
	- weakness
	- flaw
	- vulnerability
	- exploit
	- attack
- Going from vuln to mock attack is non-trivial
- How much should I care?
	- Devices
	- Designs
	- Architectures
	- Infrastructure
	- Operations
- The NSA
	- never say anything, no such agency, not seen anywhere
	- Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)
		- heavy dose of intelligence - understanding other bad people and their intentions, friends, and enemies
	- Cybersecurity (from COMSEC, INFOSEC, Information Assurance, .....)
- SIGINT had way more people and resources than Information Assurance (defenders)
- Defense wins games, Offense wins budgets
- Offense + Defense
	- Cross-training
		- everybody started getting cross-training after 9/11
	- What about NIST, DISA, etc.? 
		- Nation will not pay what it takes to build a better defensive machine, so it won't help if you go there
	- Linkage to the ecosystem (industry, policy-makers, academia)
	- Highly complex infrastructure
	- Lots of brain power
	- The sobering lesson - the NSA had too much control though
		- There had to be checks and balances and distribution
- It's not about fixing that one network but learning about one network so you can know maybe how others work
- Why did the DoD system look that way in the first place?
	- Security sampling
	- Sample the environment.  Draw conclusions about the underlying population.  
- We have to give those with power these conclusions so that something large-scale can be done
- Everybody cheats in intelligence
	- They know your laws so they can work around them
- FREE STUFF
	- NSA/DoD
	- CSIS
	- SANS Top 20
	- CCS/CIS
	- CIS Controls
- Lessons
	- Knowing vulns doesn't fix them
	- Fix it so that you don't rediscover it
	- Bad Guy doesn't do magic
	- Cybersecurity translates to Management (not threat sharing)
		- Threat feeds can't be utilized by most people - our economy is mostly small businesses
	- Business make economic and social decisions
		- We are the doctors of information systems
	- Cybersecurity is like the Groundhog Day movie
	- We feed the bigger machine that will take action for reducing risk
