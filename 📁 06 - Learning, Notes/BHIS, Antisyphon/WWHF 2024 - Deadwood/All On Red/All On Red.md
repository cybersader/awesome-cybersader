- By David Kennedy
    
- Hacking your health podcast
- Visibility is important
- People are trying to go faster with agile and automation, so it's getting real complex
- Complexity is problematic and it's a dilemma in engineering
- Vulnerability management is the hardest program for companies to adopt
- Security programs don't move at an agile workflow or speed
- Age and size are a great predictor of complexity and risk
- Organized cybercrime is adopting better revenue models like regular businesses. They are making more money and feeding that into building their weapons and exploitation methods
- There are things we can do to cover our bases way faster
- What we do
    - Detection checklists that are fragile
    - Buy tech
- EKUwu: not just another AD CS ESC
    - Worked in 75% of customers, impossible to detect, etc.
    - How many more like this are out there
    - Our industry lives in the past
    - Resilience is key
- Warfare
    - If you don't have a map of landmines, then you have to take risks
    - Attackers don't know our environment like we do. Knowledge asymmetry.
- The most important security jobs
    - Red team
    - Threat hunting
    - Detection engineering
    - They shouldn't need meetings - they should like having fun getting visibility and working in the trenches
- Deception is great
- Use the uniqueness of your landscape to your advantage
- Use what you have and automate what you don't have
- BEC is way bigger and issue with fluent AI
- AI will get good and be a good tool. Forget all the knowledge flexing contrarian IT ego arrogance. It will help us automate and simplify parts of our job so long as we archive, document, and make data available to the AI
- [SET.ai](http://SET.ai) toolkit
    - Uses ollama
- Use deception, hire people dedicated to detections (or outsource it), and get visibility
- Use AD roles to enforce on being able to run commands
- Bedford has a k12 cybersecurity program from 10th grade through senior for technical, reporting, interviews, etc.
- They want to take graduating kids and bring them through companies to become apprentices with full time jobs without college. K12 programs
    - How to get this into curriculum?
    - How to find teachers?
    - If it's cheaper to learn then people will be okay with being teachers on it
- The gap is with experience so we can't do it through college. We need networking and experience. It's not an entry level position.
- Cut down on meetings if you can
