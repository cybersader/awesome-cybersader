- Grassroots conference in Appleton Wisconsin
- Hackers only have to get it right once - set this person on fire
- It's a rant
- Why wasn't Walmart hacked - they aren't a target
- CEO of secure ideas
- The defender doesn't need to be right Everytime
- Hacker is glorified QA
- The attacker doesn't just have to get it right once
- Red teamers and blue teamers can both have egos
- One arrow works until you get in. Once you're on the network you have to get it right Everytime.
- It's not defender's dilemma but moreso a prioritization and not knowing what the attackers will likely do
- Bank in town was helping police and other city services with hosting. Sometimes the big business helps out city services.
- Knowledge asymmetry â†’ cyber deception too
- Solutions
    - Collaboration
    - Understand the risks
        - What are you worried about?
        - What's the worst possible thing to happen to your team?
- How to collab
    - Education
        - Educate about what is really important. Not the latest exploit, but the things that matter in the business.
        - For some people, a notebook will be the best option - understand the business context
    - Partnership with other teams
- Cheap awareness training - build a web server with a web page, and if they click the link, words that say you shouldn't have clicked that
- Attend the dev stand-ups, PM status meetings, and the change control board stuff
- Listen twice as much as you speak
- Be seen as a resource and not an invader
