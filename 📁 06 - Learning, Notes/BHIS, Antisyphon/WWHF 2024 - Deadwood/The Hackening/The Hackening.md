- How I would hack you
- Hacking MSPs is more nuanced than one would think
- Put out the Hackening to any MSP willing to participate
- Stuff that maybe didn't show on audits
- Lots of MSPs had basic credential stealing breaches
- Agreement was one sided - we won't touch vendor or clients but we get full immunity
- MSPs are not equalâ€¦they vary widely
- They should be IG2 OR 3+/4+
- 98% of companies less than 100 employees
- Doing pentests is expensive for MSPs that are small
- 62 total MSPs participated
- 26 signed legal agreement immediately
- 5 countries
- How do you get support for keeping pentesting infrastructure up?
- Only one noticed
- Most used Entra ID
- 45% used cloud flare or fastly proxies
- Easy to determine tech stacks
- Subdomain enumeration easy
- 32% had IPs of hosts in SPF records
- Most list clients and employees on website
