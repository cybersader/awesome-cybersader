# Part 1: Iceland's Ponzi Banks & History
- Iceland
	- 13 billion GDP in 2008
	- Bank losses : $100 billion
	- Stable democracy
	- Low unemployment
- Had high quality of living
- In 2000, Iceland had deregulation policy for environment then the economy
- They allowed Aluminum smelting plants to ravage parts of the awesome landscape
- It's geothermal properties result in beautiful green landscapes?
- Government privatized Iceland's 3 largest banks - huge experiment in deregulation
- These 3 banks borrowed 120 billion from outside Iceland
- Stock prices went up and house prices doubled since banks had more to lend 
- Millionaires started taking out huge loans from Iceland banks
- It was essentially another Ponzi scheme
	- Banks set up money market funds
	- Banks advised deposit holders to put their money in money market funds
	- Their money would double and build in the bank (a lie)
	- New deposit holder money was used for loans to millionaires who saw they could buy stuff more easily with the new deregulation
- American accounting firms like KPMG audited and found nothing wrong
- American credit rating agencies also saw nothing wrong
- Iceland's banks collapsed in 2008
- Unemployment tripled in 6 months
- Money was essentially stolen and spent on stuff
- The only winners were the people that all that money went to
- If you went to banks, would find a bunch of lawyers/regulators who ironically went to work at banks?

- September 15 2008 - Lehman brothers declares bankruptcy
- World financial markets just started falling
- Largest insurance company AIG collapsed
- Caused global recession - 10s of trillions of dollars - 30 million unemployed - doubled national debt of US
- Destruction of equity and housing wealth
- This crisis was not an accident

- Since 1980s, the rise of US financial sector lead to damaging crises - yet..the industry makes more and more money from it
- After Great Depression, America had 40 years of growth without a financial crisis
- Finance was regulated tightly - banks were local businesses not allowed to speculate with depositors' savings
- Partners would put the money up traditionally

- In 1980s, investment banks went public with huge amounts of stockholder money - Wall Street investors were getting rich
- In 1981, Ronald Reagan appointed CEO of the bank Merril Lynch as Secretary of Treasury
- They began a 30 year period of deregulation
- 1982 - deregulated savings and loan companies to make risky investments - 100s of these companies failed - costed taxpayers $124 billion
- Keating paid Alan Greenspan a lot of money - then Reagan appointed him chairman of Federal Reserve - he was reappointed Clinton and GW Bush
- All of the government figureheads had lobbied into Congress
- They captured the political system

- By late 1990s, financial sector consolidated into a few gigantic firms 
	- Clinton helped them grow
	- If any one of them failed, our economy would be hit hard
- Citicorp and Travelers merged to form largest financial company
	- Merger violated the Glass-Seagal Act - prevented consumer deposit banks from engaging in risky investment-banking activities
- Greenspan said nothing - Federal Reserve gave them an exemption for a year
- 1999 - Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act - Citigroup relief act - overturned Glass-Seagal allowing future firms

- Late 90 crisis - investment banks fueled internet stock bubble - 5 trillion in investment losses
- SEC did nothing to regulate investment banking
- Scott Talbot chief lobbyist of Financial Services roundtable in Washington - strongest financial companies in the world

- Investigations started happening - defrauding, cooking books, conspiring with other countries, wall street drugs, criminal activity, lying to investors, fraud, etc.
- Derivatives allowed bankers to gamble on anything
	- bankruptcy of companies
	- weather
	- stock price falls
- Derivatives were unregulated
- CFTC tried to regulate derivatives
- Derivatives were a destabilizing market 
- They did not want to be regulated
- Brooksley Born, the spear of this regulation movement, was defeated by these banks

- Derivatives and financial innovations exploded after 2000 and 2001
- By the time GW Bush took office, derivatives and the financial sector were incredibly profitable
- The companies:
	- Investment banks - Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, Merril Lynch, Bear Stearns
	- Financial conglomerates - Citigroup, JP Morgan
	- Securities and Insurance - AIG, MBIA, AMBAC  
	- Rating Agencies - Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch
- Securitization Food Chain
	- Home Buyers -> Lenders -> Investment Banks -> Investors
	- Connected trillions of dollars in mortgages and other loans
	- Loan payments started at home buyers and went all the way up to investors
	- With each piece promising money back to the person below

- The risky system explained
	- [(35) CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligation) that caused the global financial crisis - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=uM19CBGhhas) 
	- Old system
		- mortgages take decades to pay so lenders were careful
	- New system
		- lenders sell mortgages to investment banks (they give investment banks money with interest?)
		- investment banks combine 1000s of mortgages and other loans to have  CDO (collateralized debt obligations) (complex derivatives)
		- Investment banks pay rating agencies to evaluate the CDOs
		- These had AAA ratings - popular for retirement funds (only highly rated securities)
	- The problem:
		- Lenders didn't care if borrowers could repay - made riskier loans
		- Investment banks wanted money - more CDOs is more money
		- Rating agencies had no liability if ratings were wrong - it could screw over tons of people though
- Number of mortgage loans quadrupled in 3 years (2000 - 2003)
- This is a fancy Ponzi scheme
- Subprime loans
	- These are the riskiest
	- Combining tons of risky loans into one makes them AAA on paper
	- Investment banks prefer these because they have higher interest rates
- Massive increase in predatory lending
# Part 2: The Bubble (2001 - 2007)
- 100s of billions of dollars were going through securitization chain
- Anyone could get a mortgage, so home purchases and housing prices went up
- Subprime lending increase from 30 to 600 billion in 10 years
- Cash bonuses spiked during bubbles
- This was essentially stealing money though
- A global Ponzi scheme
- SEC had no one working

- ![](_attachments/Inside%20Job%20-%202008%20Financial%20Crisis/IMG-20240426131917892.png)

- Investment banks borrowed to buy more loans and create CDOs
- Ratio between bank's money and borrowed money ("leverage") meant more borrowed money - more leverage
- 2004 - Goldman Sachs got SEC to relax limits on leverage - allowed banks to get more leverage and gamble more
- The amount of leverage went from 3:1 to like 33:1
- You can do the math on this to see when they fail
- ![](_attachments/Inside%20Job%20-%202008%20Financial%20Crisis/IMG-20240426131917929.png)
- Leverage and failure threshold:
	- 33:1 means 100/33 = ~%3 decrease in value of asset till they lose everything
	- If they had a slight decrease and took too much risk, then they can't pay anyone back

- Credit default swaps - the other ticking time bomb
	- These were derivatives
	- For investors who owned CDOs, credit default swaps worked like insurance
	- This countered the leverage problem
	- Insurance companies like AIG could pay investors for CDO losses
	- Speculators could also buy these to bet against CDOs that they didn't own
	- These were unregulated
	- AIG didn't have to put money aside for losses - they would pay employees cash bonuses when contracts were signed - this left AIG on the hook
	- ![](_attachments/Inside%20Job%20-%202008%20Financial%20Crisis/IMG-20240426131917979.png)
	- 
- This was a distorted system of compensation

- One guy, Rajan, at the biggest banking conference in the world presented a paper showing how the financial industry was riskier
- Incentives based on short-term profits were incentives to take bigger risks without accounting for the potential losses
	- He showed how it could cause meltdown
	- They have to compensate for risk adjustment performance
	- "More profits with more risk"

- Financial executives borrowed this money from the bottom of the food chain (people paying their loans) and they used it for their extravagant lifestyles
	- Once the money was used, it was dissipated into the economy and irretrievable
	- The money is essentially stolen at this point

- Wall Street had tons of drugs, prostitution, and debauchery
- They were spending corporate money
- "Make your own invoice"
- This extended to the top of these companies

- Godman Sachs would buy credit default swaps and bet against others based on stats
- Gaoldman Sachs knew AIG would fail so they spent 150 million insuring against the collapse of AIG
- In 2007, they sold CDOs designed to make money when their customers lost
- In 2010, they had to testify against Congress
	- They would convince clients to buy terrible loans so they could make money
	- They declined telling clients of their adverse interest
	- "Do you a duty to act in best interest of clients" -- reply: "Show them prices on transactions that they ask for" (so no)
	- What do you think about selling securities that your company knows is crap?  
	- "It's unfortunate someone said that in email" -- ...WOW

- Hedge funds like Tricadia and Magnetar made billions betting against "AAA" CDOs they designed with Merril Lynch, J.P. Morgan, and Lehman Brothers.
- CDOs were sold to customers as "safe" investments

- How these subprime were rated AAA
- Moody's, S&P, and Fitch made billions giving high ratings
- They quadrupled profits
- Hundreds of billions of dollars were being rated AAA

- The argument/lawyer from the credit rating agencies: "Our ratings are our opinions"

# Part 3: The Collapse
How the bubble could burst
- a bank would become insolvent if they had something like a 33:1 leverage and their assets (home mortgages) that they borrowed decreased
-  house prices decreased and enough people started selling houses then everyone starts wanting their money back from the bottom (homebuyers)?

- By 2008, home foreclosures skyrocketed
- Securitization food chain imploded
- Lenders could no longer sell to investment banks and loans started going bad
- The market for CDOs collapsed - left them with CDOs, loans, and real estate that they couldn't sell

The beginning of the recession
- March 16, 2008 - Bear Stearns ran out of cash.  They were borrowing from mortgages that weren't being paid off, so the money ran out
	- Bear Stearns was acquired for 2 dollars per share
	- This deal was backed by 30 million dollars of emergency guarantee from the Federal Reserve
- September 7, 2008 - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (mortgage lenders) were about to collapse
	- Too many risky loans that weren't being paid off so money was lost
- Lehman Brothers had catastrophic losses of 3.2 billion dollars and the stock collapsed
	- They relied on lenders, and they were on the hook from investors
	- Their assets were essentially dissolved
- All had high investment grade ratings days before failing or being bailed out
- Regulators weren't aware of their ratings and thought they had been downgraded over time
- Governor Mishkin left Federal Reserve in the middle of crisis to go teach at business school
- September 12, 2008 - Lehman Brothers ran out of cash 
- September 14, 2008 - Merril Lynch about to fail - acquired by Bank of America
	- The Federal Government had not planned for this either

Effects of Bankruptcy 
- Lehman's failure caused collapse in paper markets - couldn't make payroll, documents, etc.

- AIG owed $13 million to credit default swap holders
- AIG was a hub - if it stopped, plane companies would have to stop flying
- September 17, 2008 - AIG taken over by the government
- Alternative would be a financial collapse of the national and global economy

> [!quote] "All of the potential root causes were called out by Secretary Paulson" 
> 
> Interviewer: 'ummmm no'
> 
> Ironically, Paulson was the senior advocate for prohibiting regulation of credit default swaps and lifting leverage regulations for banks"

- When AIG was bailed out, owners of credit default swaps were paid $61 billion the next day
	- Paulson, Bernanke, and Tim Geithner forced AIG to pay all of the money rather than negotiate lower prices (more money in Goldman Sachs pockets)
	- The most prominent receiver of this payment was Goldman Sachs
	- This bailout costs taxpayers over $150 billion - essentially $600 or more per citizen
	- $14 billion went to Goldman Sachs

- The person in charge of dealing with the crisis was the previous CEO of Goldman Sachs
- Paulson and Geithner forced AIG to surrender its right to sue Goldman and other banks for fraud
- GW Bush signed $700 billion bailout bill

The results
- Bailout did not stem the tide of layoffs and foreclosures
- GM and Chrysler faced bankruptcy
- US consumer cut back on spending and Chinese manufacturer sales plummet - 10 million migrant worker lose jobs

> [!important] Our economies are linked globally...we sort of need each other

- 6 million foreclosures by early 2010
- Foreclosures affect everyone around the house
- House will go back onto the market at a lower price, it won't be maintained for awhile, etc.
- It will lower the value of homes
- Many were defrauded by mortgage brokers who had been paid by predatory lenders who had no money left to give
# Part 4: Accountability
- The CEOs of the banks walked away with their fortunes - stolen money from a globally colluded Ponzi Scheme
- Top 5 execs of Lehman Brothers left with $1 billion

- Who's accountable in the business?
	- The board - they hire and fire CEO
	- Board composition in America is problematic because it's elected many times by the CEO
	- Board of directors and compensation committees are best situated to choose pay packages for the executives
	- Board and compensation about a "B" for grade

- Bonuses and severance 
	- Board of directors at companies gave CEOs and exec hundreds of millions of dollars
	- AIGFP Joseph Cassano was kept as a consultant for a million a month instead of being fired

- JP Morgan, Walls Fargo, and Bank of America conglomerating

- Still fighting to stay unregulated
	- Financial Services Roundtable and Financial Sector hired 3000 lobbyists - 5 for each member of Congress
	- Financial industry has political influence
	- You can walk into a hearing room, but you can't write lobbying checks

- Subtle ways financial sector exerts influence
	- Deregulation is taught in business school
	- Since 1980s, academic economists had turned into deregulation fanatics
	- They opposed reform even after crisis

- To Harvard economist - "Over last decade financial sector made about $5 billion political contributions...does that bother you?" -- No
- Martin Feldstein was on board of AIG and financial products making him millions
- "I cannot say anything more about AIG"
- Glenn Hubbard ( Harvard, Columbia, etc) - Chairman of Council of Economic Advisors under George W Bush
	- Do you think financial sector has too much political power? -- No
- Does economics discipline have a conflict of interest problem? -- No.  They don't make a lot of money usually
- They usually are for hire for huge banks

- These economists were paid big bucks to write a paper on how good the deregulated Icelandic economy was despite the collapse later
- John Campbell - Chairman of Harvard Economics Department - Does Harvard require disclosure of financial conflicts of interest with publications? -- No
	- Do you need to report compensation from outside activities? -- No -- Is that a problem? -- Don't see why
- To Martin Feldstein (Dir. AIG & AIGFP till 2009)
	- You wrote so many articles...why none around unregulated credit default swaps or executive compensation, regulation of corporate governance? -- I wouldn't have anything to add
- Glenn Hubbard:
	- Made millions consulting
	- Interviewer: "Most of your outside activities are consulting and directorship arrangement with financial sector -- correct?" 
		- My consulting clients aren't even on my CVs
	- Interviewer: "Who are your consulting clients?"
		- I don't have to discuss that with you.  In fact, you have a few more minutes and the interview's over
	- Interviewer: "Do they include other financial services firms?"
		- Possibly
	- Interview: "Do you remember?"
		- This isn't a deposition sir.  3 more minutes.
- Ferguson:
	- Do you consult? -- I don't want to go into detail about that

- 2004 (height of bubble) - Paper with Hubbard and Dudley from Goldman Sachs
	- Praised derivative markets - improved allocation of capital and of risk
	- "Enhanced financial stability" 
	- "Milder and less recessions"
	- "Distributes risk"
- Columbia and Harvard presidents declined interviews
- Economics discipline is part of the problem

# Part 5: Where We Are Now (2010)
- The rising power of financial sector was part of a big change in America
- GM and big companies were poorly managed and falling behind foreign competitors, so they started sending jobs overseas
- America's manufacturing base was destroyed
- US started leading in IT
- IT jobs require education and that's not reachable for everyone
- Private universities have billions in endowments
- Public university funding was shrinking and tuition rising
	- $650 in 70s to $10,000 in 2010
	- determinate for going to college is money to pay for it
- American tax policy shifted to favor wealthy
- Bush administration had Glenn Hubbard design tax cuts on investment gains, stock dividends, and the estate tax (all helping wealthy 1%)
- The American response to this were 1 of 2:
	- work longer hours
	- go into debt
- Middle class fell behind, so they made it easier to get credit
- People went into debt and borrowed to finance cars, homes, healthcare, and education
- Bottom 90% people lost ground between 1980 and 2007 - all going to top 1%
- Average Americans had less education than parents

- 2008 Obama pointed to Wall Street greed and lack of oversight
	- Change finance sector culture of greed
	- Risk regulator
	- Increased capital requirements
	- Consumer financial protection agency
- Enacted mid-2010 and yet reforms were somewhat weak
	- Weak in:
		- rating agencies
		- lobbying
		- compensation
- Why didn't they follow through?

> [!quote] It's a Wall Street government 

Obama's Corrupt Arsenal?
- Obama chose Timothy Geithner as Treasury Secretary 
	- (President of New York Federal Reserve during crisis)
- Key player in decision to pay Goldman Sachs 100 cents on the dollar for their credit default swaps
- When he was testifying to be Treasury Secretary, he said "I've never been a regulator."
- He did not understand his job
- The new President of Federal Reserve Bank of New York became William Dudley - former chief economist of Goldman Sachs
	- same guy who wrote paper with Hubbard that praised derivatives
- Geithner's chief of staff was Mark Patterson
	- (former lobbyist for Goldman)
- Senior Treasury Advisor became Lewis Sachs
	- (oversaw Tricadia - bet against mortgage securities it was selling)
- Commodity Futures Trading Commission
	- Obama chose Gary Gensler (Goldman Sachs executive)
		- Helped ban regulation of derivatives
- Head of SEC
	- Obama chose Mary Schapiro (former CEO of FINRA)
	- investment banking's self-regulation body
- Chief of Staff
	- Obama chose Rahm Emanuel
	- Rahm made 320k serving on the board of Freddie Mac
- Obama's Economic Recovery Board
	- Martin Feldstein and Laura Tyson
- Chief Economic Advisor
	- Obama chose Larry Summers
- These were the people who built the risky greedy structure

Obama's result
- resisted regulation of bank compensation
- foreign leaders did the opposite with their governments
	- 2009 September - finance ministers of Sweden, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain, and Germany called for G20 nations (including US) to put strict regulations on bank compensation
	- Obama administration didn't respond
- By 2010, no financial firm had been criminally prosecuted

- Prostitutes even took plea bargains

> [!quote] Why should a financial engineer be paid 10-100 times more than a real engineer? A real engineer build bridges. A financial engineer build dreams. When those dreams turn out to be nightmares, other people pay for it.

- The will tell us we need them, that we don't understand, and that it won't happen again
- It won't be easy, but some things are worth fighting for
