# The case against Boeing

- If it ain't Boeing then I ain't going
- Boeing has been thoroughly trusted by the world for years
- They've been producing safer and safer aircraft
- However more recently in the past several years something has changed because the Boeing 787 had two crashes within months of each other
- Jakarta Boeing 737 lion air crash
- 737 Max was almost brand new
- It’s all speculation till you find the black box in under 30 days
- There’s always a blame game before evidence is found
- Found orange black boxes

# Black Box Evidence

- Cyber black boxes are also a thing for small businesses
- There was a failure find for angle of attack sensors - right on takeoff
- Sensors thought it was stalling, but it wasn’t
- Air speed disagree alerts and altitude reading errors
- Downwards pressure on controls too

# Blame Game

- Everyone blaming pilots qualifications and where they were from
- They actually trained in the US

# Investigations

- Questions about 737 MAX design
- Single damaged sensor somehow broke everything?
- 737 MAX found to have erroneous MCAS (maneuvering characteristic augmentation system)
- No one ever heard of MCAS
- MCAS was only found in abbreviation section of documentation and nowhere
- If certain A of Attack was reached, then MCAS would automatically push the nose down - few lines of code
- MCAS uses speed trim motor
- Angle of attack sensor was broke and kept activating MCAS
- Pilots had never been told about the MCAS

- Senior Boeing exec said MCAS was never trained or explained because it would have been “overwhelming.”
- In high risk systems, there should be knowledge of every aspect of a system if it can have catastrophic implications

- Boeing started going to brief pilot unions
- Boeing execs were visibly worried, so they recorded
- They didn’t bring any material to inform
- They said 6 weeks to have software fixed
- “why don’t you ground the planes for those 6 weeks then” —-
- Their answer: “we don’t know if the pilots weren’t at fault”

- Crash 2 - 19 Weeks After First Crash
- No bad weather
- No altitude issues
- Second crash in 5 months with 737 MAX
- Past the 6 weeks promise

- Grounding Aircraft
- FAA has the power to ground aircraft but they said they wouldn’t without proof
- China grounded the aircraft and numerous countries
- If human lives are at stake, then the profit shouldn’t matter.  Human lives have more value
- Investigations with Physical Evidence
    - They found the jackscrew in the full nose down position, so they knew it was MCAS
- Donald Trump issued order to ground the planes
- Planes had to be flown to storage facilities and pilots didn’t want to fly them

- Congress Committee on Infrastructure and Transportation met to talk about Boeing
- Look at legislative changes to prevent crashes

- Leveraged PR campaign
- Lobbyists for Boeing were blaming pilots again
- You can’t expect pilots to compensate for flawed designs

- Cockpit information from FAA and from Ethiopian investigators
- Crew realized MCAS had kicked off and did what Boeing instructed
- MCAS ran for 10 seconds pushing aircraft down
- Runs for 10 - off for 5
- First officer said stab trim cutouts to turn off MCAS - nice job -  he got it right
- Airplane was still going too fast
- They couldn’t manually trim the airplane to recover

# Boeing Company History

- Boeing was trusted, awesome to work for, and known for quality and safety
- 1996 acquisition of McDonnel Douglas
- Mergers were happening everywhere
- Boeing was the gold standard
- This merger had negative impacts
- Boeing has a new CEO
- Cash is king - greed is good
- He wanted to hear about profit margin and cost effectiveness

- ShareValue program to put a focus on Boeing stock prices
- Employees were upset

- They drove a high risk human life affecting company like a racecar
- Moved from Seattle to Chicago
- They didn’t take shortcuts before the merger
- Profits will follow

- Airbus in Europe started competing
- Boeing was in the weird position of being challenged (mainly by Airbus)
- This didn’t happen overnight
- Airbus beat them out in market share
- Boeing started speeding up - too fast

- Quality assurance - it was about get stuff done
- “we’ve got a problem here” - attack the messenger
- Don’t bring bad news to the boss - they had incentives to increase stock price

- CEOs demanded that managers hit their marks
- They took out quality inspectors and managers out
- They had one quality person on each shift - used to have 15

- Some results:
    - Wire shavings in cords - shorts that could cause malfunctions
    - Fly by wire - short can break tons of stuff

- Whistleblowers were fired, let go, or they moved on
- Pay docked for quality concerns in writing - “maintain culpable deniability”

- Congress wanted actual documents, but they had nothing from Boeing - they were dragging their feet
- Boeing kept internal documents, emails, and memos hidden

# How Everything Went Bad

- Fuel efficiency is huge - everyone wanted this and Airbus had it
- Boeing decided to put fuel efficient engines onto the existing 737 - single aisle market segment

- Derivatives like the MAX required less time to be approved by the FAA
- If MAX was too different, then FAA would require training for the plane and things would get slowed down like crazy
- Boeing promised no flight sim training
- Boeing had hundreds of orders

- Two ways to have made a fuel efficient engine:
    - Make plane that has minimal differences
    - OR cover up a design that has MANY differences

- They had 100s of 1000s of pages
- The documents were obvious

- They had a meeting discussing the MCAS system early on
- It was a problem in 2013 early on
- Reengining a 45 year old
- They had a control loop to help pilot level out the plane - assumes the sensors are correct
- This was a new system - their solution was to cover it up
- They decided to communicate it as an addition to speed trim - used acronyms internally as MCAS

- Changed MCAS twice - made to be powerful
- Thought only for high speeds, but they needed it for low speed handling too
- MCAS was changed to use one sensor for angle of attack rather than 2 - MCAS was safety critical without redundancy - one point of failure
- FAA engineer had oversight, but these things weren’t communicated

- Hazard assessments in coord sheets showed runaway reaction time scenario tests - not responding in less than 10 seconds shows catastrophic failure
- This also required pilot training

- Internal talk about going toe to toe with regulators and avoiding sim training at all costs

- 

# Takeaways

- ethical and moral companies need to prioritize people — profits will follow
- it’s a bad sign if someone doesn’t like that you’ve documented stuff in order to maintain culpable deniability
- the answer to competition defines a company
- there should be constant clear communication between regulator and regulated
-
