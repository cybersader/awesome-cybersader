</p>


<h1>Goals For This Lab<p>

    This is an open-ended lab that will allow you to practice skills that you have learned
    throughout this course. Good luck and good hunting!
</h1>


<h1>1. Prep UAC data</h1>

<p>In a previous lab we unpacked the UAC data from Tyler Hudak's honeypot.
  If you do not currently have a <tt>/images/uac-honeypot</tt> directory in your
  virtual machine, follow the steps in the
<b>Before You Get Started</b> section of
<a href="../Ex_06/index.html">Exercise 6</a> to create this directory.</p>


<h1>2. Mount file system image</h1>

<p>Previously we were only examining the UAC data related to the honeypot. But we also have
  a file system image, which provides more evidence. We need to get the file system
  mounted up so we can inspect it:</p>

<pre>
[root@LAB lab]# <b>cd /images/All-Images/HudaksHoneypot/</b>
[root@LAB HudaksHoneypot]# <b>ls</b>
readme-hal  readme.txt  sdb.vhd.gz  uac.tgz  ubuntu.20211208.mem
[root@LAB HudaksHoneypot]# <b>gunzip sdb.vhd.gz</b>          <i>[NOTE! Can take a while!]</i>
[root@LAB HudaksHoneypot]# <b>ls -lh sdb.vhd</b>
-rw-r--r--. 1 lab lab 33G Feb 24 15:32 sdb.vhd
[root@LAB HudaksHoneypot]# <b>mmls sdb.vhd</b>
GUID Partition Table (EFI)
Offset Sector: 0
Units are in 512-byte sectors

      Slot      Start        End          Length       Description

[root@LAB HudaksHoneypot]# <b>fsstat -o 2048 sdb.vhd | grep Type:</b>
Cannot determine file system type
[root@LAB HudaksHoneypot]# <b>fsstat -o 10240 sdb.vhd | grep Type:</b>
File System Type: FAT32
[root@LAB HudaksHoneypot]# <b>fsstat -o 227328 sdb.vhd | grep Type:</b>
File System Type: Ext4
</pre>

<p>OK great! It looks like we have a simple EXT4 file system to deal with.
  No RAID, LVM, or encryption. Mounting this should be straightforward:</p>

<pre>
[root@LAB HudaksHoneypot]# <b>mkdir /mnt/honeypot</b>
[root@LAB HudaksHoneypot]# <b>mount -o ro,noexec,noload,loop,offset=$((227328*512)) sdb.vhd /mnt/honeypot</b>
[root@LAB HudaksHoneypot]# <b>ls /mnt/honeypot/</b>
1    boot  etc   initrd.img      lib    lost+found  mnt  proc  run   snap  sys  usr  vmlinuz
bin  dev   home  initrd.img.old  lib64  media       opt  root  sbin  srv   tmp  var  vmlinuz.old
</pre>

<p>Woot! There it is!</p>



<h1>3. A most useful log file</h1>

<p>We know from earlier exercises that the honeypot appears to have been compromised via the CVE-2021-41773
  Apache directory traversal vulnerability. Clearly the web logs will be an important factor in your
  investigation. You will find them under <tt>/mnt/honeypot/var/log/apache2</tt>.</p>

<pre>
[root@LAB HudaksHoneypot]# <b>cd /mnt/honeypot/var/log/apache2/</b>
[root@LAB apache2]# <b>ls</b>
access_log  error_log
</pre>

<p>However, this is not your average <tt>error_log</tt> file. Tyler enabled "<tt>mod_dumpio</tt>" in
  Apache, which means the <tt>error_log</tt> collects all of the POST data in the web requests.
  This is not a standard configuration, but it is amazingly useful because all of the exploits in
  this case are using POST.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is a lot of noise and distraction in the standard <tt>mod_dumpio</tt> output:</p>

<pre>
[root@LAB apache2]# <b>grep 5.2.72.226 error_log</b>
[Tue Nov 30 16:19:28.915559 2021] [dumpio:trace7] [pid 2632:tid 139978537424640] mod_dumpio.c(140): [client 5.2.72.226:47374] mod_dumpio: dumpio_in [getline-blocking] 0 readbytes

<i>[... snip ...]</i>
</pre>

<p>We found indicators in the UAC <tt>liveresponse/process/proc/15853/environ.txt</tt> files that IP
  address 5.2.72.226 was associated with suspicious process PID 15853. Here I am pulling out the
  <tt>mod_dumpio</tt> data associated with this IP address. You can see how difficult it is to read the output.</p>

<p>So here is a crazy bit of command line kung fu to clean up the output and make it more readable:</p>

<pre>
[root@LAB apache2]# <b>grep 5.2.72.226 error_log  | grep -Ev '[0-9]* (read)?bytes' | sed 's/\[dumpio.*data-HEAP)://; s/\[pid .* AH[0-9]*://'</b>

<i>[... snip ...]</i>
</pre>

<p>Just change the IP address in the first part of the command line to whichever IP address you want to
  investigate and leave the rest of the command line alone. Or maybe you can improve on my filter. Either
  way, this should be enough to get you going.</p>


<h1>4. Known indicators</h1>

<p>As a starting point, here are some of the known indicators we found in our earlier investigations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Suspicious URLs hosting exploit code, with <tt>wget</tt> and/or <tt>curl</tt> commands shown
    in <tt>mod_dumpio</tt> data in many cases:<p>

    <tt>http://45.137.155.55/ap.sh<br>
    http://45.137.155.55/kinsing<br>
    http://45.137.155.55/libsystem.so<br>
    http://88.218.227.141/wget.sh<br>
    http://185.191.32.198/ap.sh<br>
    http://185.191.32.198/unk.sh<br>
    https://tmpfiles.org/dl/168017/wk.sh<br></tt></li><p>

  <li>Outbound HTTP or HTTPS connections to other external IP addresses:<p>

    <tt>3.123.183.86<br>
    3.66.81.63<br>
    18.198.162.56<br>
    40.79.154.83<br>
    40.79.154.87<br>
    91.189.91.38<br>
    91.189.91.39<br>
    185.104.45.29<br>
    185.199.111.133<br></tt></li><p>
    
  <li>Shell process PID 20645 (and child process 6388), running as user "<tt>daemon</tt>" from deleted
    directory <tt>/var/tmp/.log/101068/.spoollog</tt>. Associated with a POST request from IP address
    116.202.187.77 using Curl v7.79.1.</li><p>

  <li>Process hierarchy PID 15851 (bash) -&gt; PID 15853 (sh) -&gt; PID 6830 (sleep 30), running as user
    "<tt>daemon</tt>" from directory <tt>/tmp</tt>. Also believed to be associated with XMRig coin miner
    running as <tt>/tmp/agettyd</tt> (binary deleted). Associated with POST request from IP address
    5.2.72.226 using Curl v7.79.1.</li><p>
    
  <li>Process hierarchy PID 21783 (bash) -&gt; PID 21785 (sh) -&gt; PID 6803 (sleep 30), running as user
    "<tt>daemon</tt>" from directory <tt>/tmp</tt>. Associated with POST request from IP address
    104.244.76.13 using Curl v7.79.1. Nearly identical to process data associated with IP address
    5.2.72.226.</li><p>

  <li><tt>/tmp/agettyd</tt> process is communicating via SSL with IP address 107.178.104.10</li><p>

  <li><tt>/var/tmp/dk86</tt> and <tt>/run/lock/dk86</tt> are owned by user "<tt>daemon</tt>".</li><p>

  <li>Scheduled task <tt>/root/.remove.sh</tt> runs from <tt>/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root</tt>.
    Apparently a clean-up job created by Tyler Hudak.</li></p>
</ul>    



<h1>5. Choose your own adventure!</h1>

<p>You could spend days investigating this image. There are multiple different actors all hitting
  this machine over the course of multiple weeks.</p>

<p>Here are some investigative ideas to get you going:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Investigate the <tt>/root/.remove.sh</tt> scheduled task. Does it look like a legitimate
    admin task? What files/directories does it impact? Can you find evidence of it executing?</li><p>

    <li>Fill in the details around the exploits hosted at URLs like <tt>http://45.137.155.55/ap.sh</tt>.
      What is the source of the web requests that trigger calls to these URLs? Are
      <tt>http://45.137.155.55/ap.sh</tt> and <tt>http://185.191.32.198/ap.sh</tt> used by the same
      actor or different actors?</li><p>

    <li>Are the exploits from IP address 5.2.72.226 and 104.244.76.13 the same actor, or different
      actors using the same toolkit? Do you see evidence of similar exploits from other IP addresses?</li><p>

    <li>Now that you have the <tt>mod_dumpio</tt> logs, fill in more detail about the exploit from
      IP address 116.202.187.77 and the deleted <tt>/var/tmp/.log/101068/.spoollog</tt> directory.</li><p>

    <li>Where did <tt>/var/tmp/dk86</tt> come from?</li><p>

    <li>Do you see any other suspicious files in <tt>/tmp</tt> or <tt>/var/tmp</tt>? Where did they
      come from?</li><p>

    <li>Can you recover the deleted <tt>/tmp/agettyd</tt> binary?</li><p>

    <li>We saw outgoing HTTP and/or HTTPS connections to several external IP addresses. What triggered
      these connections? Can you discover what data may have been transferred?</li><p>

    <li>How many different actors can you show evidence of? Who was the first to hit the machine?
      Who was the most recent? Do you see any evolution of tactics over the weeks the machine was
      available?</li><p>

    <li>Can you find any evidence of any exploit managing to escalate privilege?</li><p>
</ul>

<p>There is plenty to work on! If you get hung up on one investigation, try working on something else.</p>

<p>I have written a series of
  <a href="https://righteousit.wordpress.com/2021/12/20/hudaks-honeypot-part-1/" target=_blank>blog posts</a>
  that cover my investigation of some of the above items. These may help if you get stuck, but obviously
  they contain lots of spoilers!</p>
