<h1>Before You Get Started</h1>

Note that for this lab to work, you will need to have our compromised
web server image mounted. If your 
<tt>/mnt/test/data</tt> directory is empty, follow the steps in the
<b>Before You Get Started</b> section of
<a href="../Ex_10/index.html">Exercise 10</a> to mount the image.</p>


<h1>1. User <tt>mail</tt></h1>

<p>From our early disk triage and timeline analysis, we know that the
<tt>/var/mail/.bash_history</tt> file was updated during the incident.
Let's take a look at that first:</p>

<pre>
[root@LAB lab13]# <b>cd /mnt/test/data/var/mail/</b>
[root@LAB mail]# <b>ls -A</b>
.bash_history  .cache
[root@LAB mail]# <b>cat .bash_history</b>
sudo su -
w
ll
ls -l
ls -la
pwd
logout 
w
last
sudo su -
logout 
sudo su -
passwd php
sudo su -
logout 
sudo su -
logout 
</pre>

<p>There's not a huge amount of information here. Mostly our attacker logged in as
mail, sometimes ran the "<tt>w</tt>" command to see if anybody else was logged into
the system, and then did "<tt>sudo su -</tt>" to get root privileges.</p>

<p>While there are
no timestamps in the logs, we should be able to pinpoint the times of the 
"<tt>sudo su -</tt>" commands using the Sudo logs in <tt>auth.log</tt>:</p>

<pre>
[root@LAB mail]# <b>grep 'sudo: *mail' /mnt/test/data/var/log/auth.log</b>
Oct  5 13:14:04 VulnOSv2 sudo:     mail : TTY=pts/1 ; PWD=/var/mail ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/su -
Oct  5 13:19:21 VulnOSv2 sudo:     mail : TTY=pts/1 ; PWD=/var/mail ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/su -
Oct  5 13:21:11 VulnOSv2 sudo:     mail : TTY=pts/1 ; PWD=/var/mail ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/su -
Oct  5 13:21:30 VulnOSv2 sudo:     mail : TTY=pts/1 ; PWD=/var/mail ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/su -
Oct  5 13:23:39 VulnOSv2 sudo:     mail : TTY=pts/1 ; PWD=/var/mail ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/su -
</pre>

<p>It's a reasonable assumption that the timestamps on the five log entries above
correspond with the "<tt>sudo su -</tt>" commands from <tt>.bash_history</tt>.</p>

<p>Also mixed into the <tt>.bash_history</tt> is a "<tt>passwd php</tt>" command.
This command should fail--normal users are not allowed to reset passwords for other users.
Let's see what the logs have to say:</p>

<pre>
[root@LAB mail]# <b>grep passwd /mnt/test/data/var/log/auth.log | grep php</b>
Oct  5 13:21:24 VulnOSv2 passwd[3080]: passwd: can't view or modify password information for php
Oct  5 13:21:34 VulnOSv2 passwd[3097]: pam_smbpass(passwd:chauthtok): Failed to find entry for user php.
Oct  5 13:21:39 VulnOSv2 passwd[3097]: pam_unix(passwd:chauthtok): password changed for php
Oct  5 13:21:39 VulnOSv2 passwd[3097]: pam_smbpass(passwd:chauthtok): Failed to find entry for user php.
</pre>

<p>"<tt>passwd: can't view or modify password information for
  php</tt>"-- that's the log message you're going to get when you
  "<tt>passwd php</tt>" as a regular user. This message occurs at
  timestamp 13:21:24.  Looking at the <tt>.bash_history</tt> entries,
  the "<tt>passwd php</tt>" command comes between the third (at
  13:21:11) and fourth (13:21:30) "<tt>sudo su -</tt>" commands.  So
  everything seems to line up here from a timing perspective.</p>


<h1>2. Looking at <tt>/root/.bash_history</tt></h1>

<p>Now let's take a look at <tt>/root/.bash_history</tt>:</p>

<pre>
[root@LAB mail]# <b>cd /mnt/test/data/root</b>
[root@LAB root]# <b>ls -A</b>
.bash_history  .bashrc  .cache  flag.txt  .profile  .psql_history  .viminfo
[root@LAB root]# <b>cat .bash_history</b>
poweroff
whoami
id
pwd
vim /etc/passwd
ll
vim flag.txt 
cat .psql_history 
cd /var/www/html/
ll
cd jabc
ll
cat .htaccess 
ll
vim scripts/update.php
ls -lh scripts/
w
logout 
vim /var/log/lastlog 
logout 
passwd php 
logout 
cd /tmp/
ll
rm 37292.c 
cd
ls -lha
ls .cache/
cat .cache/motd.legal-displayed 
logout 
</pre>

<p>Can we correlate what we see here against the data points from our previous
investigations of the system?</p>

<ul>
<li>Looking at the timeline data, we speculated that at 11:14:38 UTC 
the attacker edited 
<tt>/etc/passwd</tt> with <tt>vim</tt>, possibly to move the <tt>php</tt>
account entry. This could be the <tt>vim /etc/passwd</tt> command we see above.</li><p>

<li>The creation time on the <tt>update.php</tt> webshell was 11:17:42 UTC.
You can see "<tt>vim scripts/update.php</tt>" in the history above.</li><p>

<li>Log messages show the password for the <tt>php</tt> account was successfully
changed at 11:21:39 UTC. That would be the "<tt>passwd php</tt>" command in
the history above.</li><p>
</ul>

<p>However, there are other entries in the history that we did not place in our
incident timeline. I will let you investigate <tt>/root/flag.txt</tt> on your own
and let you decide if it's relevant to our scenario.</p>

<p>The part of the history that I am more interested in is these few lines:</p>

<pre>
cd /tmp/
ll
rm 37292.c 
</pre>

<p>That appears to be <tt>root</tt> removing a file named <tt>/tmp/37292.c</tt>.
During our timeline analysis lab, it appeared that the suspected privilege escalation
exploit found in <tt>/tmp</tt> was compiled from source on this machine. But we never
found the source code. Could the source have been in <tt>/tmp/37292.c</tt>?</p>

<p>If your Google-ing for the CVE-2015-1328 privilege escalation brought you to
the Exploit DB web site, then you might recognise "37292" as the Exploit DB entry
number for the CVE-2015-1328 exploit. Did our attackers simply download the
exploit from Exploit DB and compile it? At least it gives us something definitive
to look for in unallocated. Can you find the deleted source code file now?</p>


<h1>3. <tt>/root/.viminfo</tt></h1>

<p>The <tt>/root/.bash_history</tt> shows a number of <tt>vim</tt> commands. That means
we should be able to see some more detail in <tt>/root/.viminfo</tt>. Here are a chunk
of the more relevant lines:</p>

<pre>
<i>[... snip ...]</i>
# Registers:
"0	LINE	0
	php:x:999:999::/usr/php:/bin/bash
"1	LINE	0
	php:x:999:999::/usr/php:/bin/bash

# File marks:
'0  1  0  /var/log/lastlog
'1  3  1  /var/www/html/jabc/scripts/update.php
'2  2  0  ~/flag.txt
'3  29  0  /etc/passwd
'4  6  25  ~/flag.txt
'5  1  26  /etc/issue

# Jumplist (newest first):
-'  1  0  /var/log/lastlog
-'  3  1  /var/www/html/jabc/scripts/update.php
-'  1  0  /var/www/html/jabc/scripts/update.php
-'  2  0  ~/flag.txt
-'  1  0  ~/flag.txt
-'  29  0  /etc/passwd
-'  1  0  /etc/passwd
-'  6  25  ~/flag.txt
-'  1  26  /etc/issue
-'  1  26  /etc/issue
<i>[... snip ...]</i>
</pre>

<p>The <tt>Registers:</tt> section implies that the <tt>php</tt> user password entry
was yanked and pasted within the editor. This matches our theory that somebody used <tt>vim</tt>
to move this account entry in the file.</p>

<p><tt>File marks:</tt> show files that the user edited and the <tt>Jumplist</tt> gives 
the order the files were edited in (most recent to oldest). The ordering here matches
both the <tt>.bash_history</tt> and our timeline. So if the attacker were engaged in
some kind of anti-forensics here, they were either very good or very lucky.</p>

<p>Frankly the <tt>.viminfo</tt> file is not well documented. There's an interesting 
forensics paper/presentation in reverse-engineering the format of this file and discussing
the areas of forensic relevance.</p>



<h1>Summary of Findings</h1>

<p>There's plenty more investigation you could do on your own, but let's try to
create a "final" incident timeline based on what we've learned:</p>

<pre>
2019-10-05 11:01:27    Metasploit? CVE-2018-7600? exploit launched from 192.168.210.131
2019-10-05 11:01:29    Metasploit? CVE-2018-7600? exploit launched from 192.168.210.131

2019-10-05 11:04:14    /tmp/apache-xTRhUVX executable dropped by www-data
                       (CVE-2015-1328 privilege escalation? compiled on system?)
                       ("rm /tmp/37292.c" in /root/.bash_history may reference Exploit DB)

2019-10-05 11:06:38    root "sudo useradd ... php"

2019-10-05 11:08:31    chsh command runs, user mail shell set to /bin/bash

2019-10-05 11:09:03    chpasswd sets password for user mail

2019-10-05 11:09:18    usermod adds mail to "sudo" group

2019-10-05 11:13:53    First login by user mail from 192.168.210.131

2019-10-05 11:14:04    mail account first "sudo su -"

2019-10-05 11:14:38    /etc/passwd modifications (php account moved via vim?)
                       (supported by /root/.bash_history and .viminfo)

2019-10-05 11:17:42    /var/www/html/jabc/scripts/update.php webshell
                       added by root account (see /root/.bash_history)

2019-10-05 11:17:49    update.php webshell access from 192.168.210.131
                       (errors in Apache error_log)

2019-10-05 11:17:54    update.php webshell access from 192.168.210.131

2019-10-05 11:21:34    passwd command fails to update php account
                       (/var/mail/.bash_history)

2019-10-05 11:21:39    passwd command used to change php password
                       (/root/.bash_history)

2019-10-05 11:23:34    last login for mail user from 192.168.210.131

2019-10-05 11:23:39    last "sudo su -" for mail user
</pre>

<p>At this point you might be asking yourself why <tt>/root/.bash_history</tt>
isn't showing the "<tt>sudo useradd ... php</tt>" command, or the commands
that were used to unlock the <tt>mail</tt> account. Those commands would have
started in a root shell that came from running the <tt>/tmp/apache-xTRhUVX</tt>
privilege escalation exploit after compromising the system with the Drupal 
remote code exploit. It's likely that shell was in such a weird state that
no history would be logged--either that or the attacker intentionally disabled
shell history. But the "root shell was in a strange state" theory is probably more
believable.</p>
