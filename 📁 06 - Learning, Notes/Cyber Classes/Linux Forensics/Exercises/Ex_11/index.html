<h1>Before You Get Started</h1>

Note that for this lab to work, you will need to have our compromised
web server image mounted. If your 
<tt>/mnt/test/data</tt> directory is empty, follow the steps in the
<b>Before You Get Started</b> section of
<a href="../Ex_10/index.html">Exercise 10</a> to mount the image.</p>


<h1>1. Creating Bodyfiles</h1>

<p>The first step is to create bodyfiles for the root and <tt>/boot</tt> file
systems, using the techniques I documented in the slides:</p>

<pre>
[root@LAB etc]# <b>mkdir -p /images/lab11</b>
[root@LAB etc]# <b>cd /images/lab11/</b>
[root@LAB lab11]# <b>fls -r -m / /dev/VulnOSv2-vg/root | gzip >bodyfile-root.gz</b>
[root@LAB lab11]# <b>fls -r -m /boot -o 2048 /mnt/test/img/ewf1 | gzip >bodyfile-boot.gz</b>
</pre>

<p>As a reminder, the <tt>-r</tt> flag means <i>recursively</i> walk through the
entire file system. <tt>-m</tt> means output in <tt>mactime</tt> format and the
directory path that follows is the mount prefix to prepend to all file paths.
In the case of the <tt>/boot</tt> file system, we also have to specify a sector
offset where the file system starts in our disk image. I'm <tt>gzip</tt>-ing both
bodyfiles to save space.</p>


<h1>2. Create Filtered Timeline</h1>

<p>Based on our triage steps in the last lab, it appears that the attacker activity
happend on Oct 5, 2019. Just to be on the safe side, let's build our timeline from
Oct 4 onwards:</p>

<pre>
[root@LAB lab11]# <b>zcat bodyfile-* | 
                    mactime -d 2019-10-04 | 
                    grep -v deleted-realloc >timeline.csv</b>
[root@LAB lab11]# <b>wc -l timeline.csv</b>
3327 timeline.csv
</pre>

<p>Note that I have added an extra step in the pipeline with the 
"<tt>grep -v deleted-realloc</tt>". The <tt>fls</tt> command adds this tag when
it finds a deleted directory entry pointing to an inode that has been reused by
another file. For the most part, I find these entries more distracting than
useful, so I filter them out as a first pass.</p>

<p>What I did <i>not</i> do is use the <tt>-y</tt> option for ANSI dates
or include the <tt>passwd</tt> and <tt>group</tt> information from the image.
That's because I plan to use Eric Zimmerman's Timeline Explorer to view my
timeline and it wants dates in the default format and numeric User and Group IDs.</p>

<p>You will now need to open the <tt>timeline.csv</tt> file to view the timeline.
I have included LibreOffice in the lab VM, or you could copy the file to your host
operating system and use Excel. But if you have a Windows host operating system, 
I recommend trying out Eric Zimmerman's
Timeline Explorer tool, which you can download from
<a href="https://ericzimmerman.github.io/" target="_blank">https://ericzimmerman.github.io/</a>.


<h1>3. First Pivot Point</h1>

<p>There are over 3300 lines in our timeline. We need to be able to get to the
actionable data quickly. This is where the concept of <i>pivot points</i> becomes
so important. What do we know from our earlier disk triage? What were the most
significant events? Starting with those events as a pivot point, we can begin
to analyze the most relevant sections of the timeline.</p>

<p>The earliest event we noted was the creation of the <tt>/tmp/apache-xTRhUVX</tt>
executable, which appeared to be the attacker's privilege escalation mechanism.
Let's jump to the point in the timeline where that file is created.</p>

<img src="images/01-first-pivot.png">

<p>In addition to the "Timestamp" and "File Name" columns, pay attention to the 
"macb" column that tells you which of the timestamps are being updated at this 
time. In the highlighted row in the screen shot we see "m.cb", which means all 
timestamps <i>except</i> atime are being updated--typical when a file is newly
created. If you search for it, you'll find the atime update on this file farther
down the timeline when the program is executed.</p>

<p>Looking at the lines around the creation of the file, it appears that a program
is being compiled. Scroll a few more lines backward and you'll see the atime on the
GCC compiler being updated, which indicates that it's being executed. Since we see
no other btime updates happening, it's reasonable to assume what is being compiled
is the exploit <tt>/tmp/apache-xTRhUVX</tt>.</p>

<p>But then shouldn't we see some source code files being dropped on the system
before the executable is compiled? Scrolling backwards from this point in the
timeline, I see nothing that looks like source code. Perhaps the source code was
cleaned up by the attackers.</p>

<p>However, as we scroll backwards we do pick up some clues about
the vulnerable web app that may have been exploited:</p>

<img src="images/02-drupal.png">

<p>Given Drupal's security history, an exploit of some sort isn't too hard to
believe. It's difficult to tell from the timeline data exactly <i>which</i>
Drupal exploit is being used. Perhaps looking at the web logs in a later lab
will give us some clues.</p>


<h1>4. Running the Exploit</h1>

<p>Now jump to the atime update on <tt>/tmp/apache-xTRhUVX</tt> and see what
the timeline tells us about artifacts from the running exploit:</p>

<img src="images/03-exploit.png">

<p>There's a <tt>/tmp/ccOOU3I8.c</tt> file that gets dropped when the exploit
runs and is apparently deleted later (bonus points if you can recover the
file from unallocated). There are also references to overlayfs and 
<tt>/tmp/ofs-lib.so</tt> which you may have seen if you found the exploit
code via Google in the previous lab exercise.</p>

<p>After the exploit runs in <tt>/tmp</tt> you can see atime updates on
<tt>whoami</tt> and <tt>useradd</tt>. The <tt>whoami</tt> program would
be one way for the attacker to determine if their privilege escalation
exploit gave them root access. <tt>useradd</tt> is used to create new user accounts. The timeline
shows us the home directory of the new user being created:</p>

<img src="images/04-phpacct.png">

<p>The home directory of the <tt>php</tt> user is created right after
the <tt>useradd</tt> command runs. So that seems to be the account that
got created here. Around that event we can see the updates to the 
<tt>passwd</tt> and <tt>group</tt> files we found in the last exercise.<p>

<p>Just a bit further down you'll see atime evidence that <tt>chsh</tt>
(<i>change shell</i>) and <tt>chpasswd</tt> (<i>change password</i>) were
executed. I'm assuming this was the updates the attacker did to unlock
the <tt>mail</tt> account. <tt>usermod</tt> could be used to add <tt>mail</tt>
to the <tt>sudo</tt> group.</p>

<img src="images/05-mailacct.png">


<h1>5. A <tt>sudo</tt> Story</h1>

<p>In the previous exercise, I mentioned that the <tt>/var/lib/sudo/mail</tt>
directory was an indicator that the <tt>mail</tt> account was using sudo.
Let's use the creation of this directory as our next pivot point and see what
sort of story the file system artifacts tell us.</p>

<img src="images/06-mailsudo.png">

<p>Immediately after <tt>/var/lib/sudo/mail</tt> gets created we see
<tt>/root/.bashrc</tt> and <tt>/root/.profile</tt> being read, along
with <tt>/etc/pam.d/su</tt>. I am willing to bet that the <tt>mail</tt>
account did something like "<tt>sudo su</tt>".</p>

<p>The next thing we see is an atime update on the <tt>vim</tt> text
editor. Going a bit farther down the timeline, we can speculate about
which file was being edited:</p>

<img src="images/07-vimpasswd.png">

<p>Looks like modifications to <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>--perhaps relocating
the <tt>php</tt> account in the file? The command history and <tt>.viminfo</tt>
file from root's home directory can be used to confirm this theory.
We will check that out in a later lab exercise.</p>


<h1>Summary of Findings</h1>

<p>So how can we flesh out our timeline from the last exercise with
these new findings?</p>

<pre>
&lt;time unknown&gt;   Possible Drupal remote code exploit

2019-10-05 11:04:14    /tmp/apache-xTRhUVX executable dropped by www-data
                       (CVE-2015-1328 privilege escalation? compiled on system?)

2019-10-05 11:06:38    useradd command runs, php account added

2019-10-05 11:08:31    chsh command runs (unlock mail account?)
2019-10-05 11:09:03    chpasswd command runs (again mail account?)
2019-10-05 11:09:18    usermod command runs (mail into sudo group?)

2019-10-05 11:09:18    /etc/group modification (mail and php in "sudo" group)

2019-10-05 11:14:02    mail account first sudo usage ("sudo su"?)

2019-10-05 11:14:38    /etc/passwd modifications (php account moved via vim?)

2019-10-05 11:17:42    /var/www/html/jabc/scripts/update.php webshell
                       added by root account

2019-10-05 11:21:39    /etc/shadow modification (mail and php accounts???)
</pre>

<p>We haven't really investigated the last two items via our timeline.
See what clues you can pick out on your own!</p>
