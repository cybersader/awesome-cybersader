<h1>1. Mission Briefing and Files</h1>

<p>You have reports of a machine in your environment behaving strangely. The CPU is maxed but the SREs
can find no process using that much of the CPU. The machine is making connections to external IP addresses,
but again there is no process that appears to be responsible for them. The machine has been isolated and
a memory dump taken. You have been tasked to analyze the memory image and report your findings.</p>

<p>First uncompress the memory image of the infected machine into the <tt>/images/lab08</tt> directory:</p>

<pre>
root@LAB:/images/lab06$ <b>cd /images/lab08/</b>
root@LAB:/images/lab08$ <b>zcat /images/All-Images/rootkit-memory/memory-father.lime.gz &gt;memory.lime</b>
root@LAB:/images/lab08$ <b>ls</b>
clean-check_syscall  memory.lime  profile.json
</pre>

<p>Let's assume you were able to beg, borrow, or steal an appropriate Volatility profile to match the memory
image-- saved here as <tt>profile.json</tt>.</p>


<h1>2. Looking for Evil Modules</h1>

<p>If you suspect an LKM rootkit, your best bet is to try
the <tt>Check_modules</tt> plugin:</p>

<pre>
$ <b>vol3.py -s . -f memory.lime linux.check_modules.Check_modules</b>

Module Address  Module Name

0xffffc0bb0b40  vmw_vsock_virtio_transport_commo
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, no obvious smoking gun here, just an apparent false-positive that we have seen before.</p>

<p>If we had an uncompromised system to compare against, we could use our trick of comparing the output
from <tt>Check_syscall</tt>. The <tt>clean-check_syscall</tt> files contains the output of the <tt>Check_syscall</tt>
plugin from an uninfected system of the same type as the infected machine. Let's see what our trick
tells us:</p>

<pre>
lab@LAB:/images/lab08$ <b>vol3.py -s . -f memory.lime linux.check_syscall.Check_syscall >infected-check_syscall</b>
lab@LAB:/images/lab08$ <b>awk '{print $5}' clean-check_syscall infected-check_syscall | sort | uniq -u</b>
</pre>

<p>It appears that the two systems are showing identical syscall interfaces. Based on our in-class discussion,
this would seemingly indicate no syscall type hooks in the infected memory image.</p>


<h1>3. Alternate Theories</h1>

<p>At this point we are seeing no indications of an LKM style rootkit. But reports of possible hidden processes
would seem to indicate some type of rootkit is present.</p>

<p>Another possibility would be an "LD_PRELOAD" style rootkit. LD_PRELOAD rootkits are userspace-based rootkits
that use malicious shared libraries to accomplish their mission. Processes are forced to load the malicious
shared object, which then hooks various system and library calls in order to subvert their behavior. And this isn't
even hard to do in Linux-- it's as simple as adding the path to your malicious shared library in a file
like <tt>/etc/ld.so.preload</tt>.</p>

<p>The thing about LD_PRELOAD rootkits is that they are extremely indiscriminate in most cases. You'll find the 
malicious module in the memory space of every userland process on the system. And a little command line trickery
makes them stand out:</p>

<pre>
lab@LAB:/images/lab08$ <b>vol3.py -s . -f memory.lime linux.elfs.Elfs | awk '{print $5}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n</b>
<i>[...snip...]</i>
     56 /usr/usr/lib/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcre2-8.so.0.10.1
     58 /usr/usr/lib/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1
     72 /usr/usr/lib/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread-2.31.so
     78 /usr/usr/lib/usr/lib/libpersist.so.1
     78 /usr/usr/lib/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.31.so
     78 /usr/usr/lib/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.31.so
     78 /usr/usr/lib/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl-2.31.so
     81 [vdso]
</pre>

<p>Take all of the object paths from the <tt>Elfs</tt> plugin and count the number of times each path appears in the
output ("<tt>... | sort | uniq -c</tt>"). Then we sort the output by the counts ("<tt>... | sort -n</tt>").</p>

<p>Only four objects appear to be linked into all processes. The system C library ("<tt>libc-*.so</tt>") is
expected, as are the dynamic link loader libraries ("<tt>ld-*.so</tt>" and "<tt>libdl-*.so</tt>").
But never in my life have I seen a library named <tt>/usr/lib/libpersist.so.1</tt>. This is almost certainly
a malicious module, and you will want to extract it from the system image and hand it off to your malware
analysts.</p>



<h1>4. Hidden Processes</h1>

<p>The SREs operating the infected machine could find no trace of the process that was consuming so much CPU.
But now that we are analyzing the memory image without the rootkit's interference, we may have better luck.</p>

<p>Again we will fall back on the technique of looking for processes running from suspcious directories:</p>

<pre>
lab@LAB:/images/lab08$ <b>vol3.py -s . -f memory.lime linux.elfs.Elfs | grep -v /usr | grep -v vdso</b>

PID     Process Start   End     File Path

1346    xmrig   0x55f5cb808000  0x55f5cb80b000  /root/root/qazwsx/root/qazwsx/xmrig
</pre>

<p><tt>xmrig</tt> is a known cryptocurrency miner and that executable path certainly looks suspicious,
even ignoring the mess Volatility is making of the path.</p>

<p>Let's see if we can get any further details about this process:</p>

<pre>
lab@LAB:/images/lab08$ <b>vol3.py -s . -f memory.lime linux.psaux.PsAux | grep 1346</b>
1346    1341    xmrig   /root/qazwsx/xmrig 107.178.104.10
lab@LAB:/images/lab08$ <b>vol3.py -s . -f memory.lime linux.lsof.Lsof --pid 1346</b>

PID     Process FD      Path

1346    xmrig   0       /dev/pts/0
1346    xmrig   1       /dev/null
1346    xmrig   2       /dev/null
1346    xmrig   3       socket:[24290]
1346    xmrig   4       socket:[24292]
</pre>

<p>We can see an IP address of interest on the command line reported by <tt>PsAux</tt>. The <tt>Lsof</tt>
output is interesting in a couple of ways. Most obviously it appears that the program is using network
sockets-- not surprising based on the initial reports of network activity and the command line option
we see in the <tt>PsAux</tt> output. However, also note that the standard input (FD 0) for the process
is <tt>/dev/pts/0</tt> indicating the process may be running from an existing interactive session on 
the machine.</p>


<h1>5. Network Details</h1>

<p>Let's look at the network info related to our suspicious process:</p>

<pre>
lab@LAB:/images/lab08$ <b>vol3.py -s . -f memory.lime linux.sockstat.Sockstat --pid 1346</b>

NetNS   Pid     FD      Sock Offset     Family  Type    Proto   Source Addr     Source Port     Destination Addr       Destination Port State   Filter

4026531992      1346    3       0x92ff85d45c00  AF_INET RAW     ICMP    0.0.0.0 1       0.0.0.0 0       UNCONNECTED    -
4026531992      1346    4       0x92ffa1a71300  AF_INET6        RAW     ICMPv6  ::      58      ::      0       UNCONNECTED     -
</pre>

<p>Interesting! The socket connections are ICMP based rather than TCP or UDP. Could our coin miner be tunneling
communications over ICMP? You should alert your malware analysis team to this possibility.</p>


<h1>6. Session Information</h1>

<p>If we suspect the process was started by an interactive session, perhaps <tt>PsTree</tt> will give us
some insights:</p>

<pre>
lab@LAB:/images/lab08$ <b>vol3.py -s . -f memory.lime linux.pstree.PsTree</b>
<i>[...snip...]</i>
* 0x92ff86128000        668     668     1       sshd
** 0x92ff88e92f80       1214    1214    668     sshd
*** 0x92ff87a397c0      1252    1252    1214    sshd
**** 0x92ff88ad4740     1279    1279    1252    bash
***** 0x92ff89bf5f00    1341    1341    1279    bash
****** 0x92ff8a0c4740   1346    1346    1341    xmrig
<i>[...snip...]</i>
</pre>

<p>The suspicious process was indeed started by an interactive login session. The bash shells appear to be
active, so perhaps we can get some command history.</p>

<p>Let's work backwards. We'll start with the shell that started our suspicious <tt>xmrig</tt> process:</p>

<pre>
lab@LAB:/images/lab08$ <b>vol3.py -s . -f memory.lime linux.bash.Bash --pid 1341</b>

PID     Process CommandTime     Command

1341    bash    2023-04-02 15:06:45.000000      /root/qazwsx/xmrig 107.178.104.10 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
</pre>

<p>The command line is certainly clear, but what's curious is that there doesn't appear to be any
of the previous history loaded from the <tt>bash_history</tt> file. Something is definitely off about
this shell process.</p>

<p>Now let's look at the earlier bash process:</p>

<pre>
lab@LAB:/images/lab08$ <b>vol3.py -s . -f memory.lime linux.bash.Bash --pid 1279</b>

PID     Process CommandTime     Command

1279    bash    2023-04-02 15:05:42.000000      /bin/su
1279    bash    2023-04-02 15:05:42.000000      sudo reboot
1279    bash    2023-04-02 15:05:42.000000      hostname -I
1279    bash    2023-04-02 15:05:42.000000      sudo reboot
1279    bash    2023-04-02 15:05:42.000000      sudo -s
1279    bash    2023-04-02 15:05:42.000000      internal_fifos
1279    bash    2023-04-02 15:05:42.000000      sudo -s
1279    bash    2023-04-02 15:05:42.000000      sudo -s
1279    bash    2023-04-02 15:05:42.000000      type fullstat
1279    bash    2023-04-02 15:05:42.000000      sudo -s
(c79    bash    2023-04-02 15:05:42.000000      ATA��SH��
1279    bash    2023-04-02 15:05:51.000000      /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
1279    bash    2023-04-02 15:05:51.000000      export HISTFILE=/dev/null
1279    bash    2023-04-02 15:05:57.000000      qazwsx=foo su
</pre>

<p>We have some loaded history here. In fact, all but the last three commands appear to come from previous
shell history. Note the attempt at some history antiforensics-- "<tt>export HISTFILE=/dev/null.</tt>"<p>

<p>The final command is very interesting though. The <tt>su</tt> program is executed but first the user
sets a strange variable. Note that this variable name matches the name of the directory where the <tt>xmrig</tt>
program was located. The string "<tt>qazwsx</tt>" seems to be significant to the malware. We could look
for this string in the memory image:</p>

<pre>
lab@LAB:/images/lab08$ <b>strings -a memory.lime | grep qazwsx | sort -u</b>
[00m$ qazwsx=foo s
[00m$ qazwsx=foo su
[00m# /root/qazwsx/xmrig
[00m# /root/qazwsx/xmrig 107.178.104.10 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
qazwsx
qazwsxc.swp
qazwsxedc
qazwsx=foo
qazwsx=foo su
/root/qazwsx/xm
/root/qazwsx xmrig
/root/qazwsx/xmrig
_=/root/qazwsx/xmrig
/root/qazwsx/xmrig 107.178.104.10 &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
/root/qazwsx/xmrig 107.178.104.10 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
root/qazwsx/xmrig 107.178.104.10 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
root/qazwsx/xmrig 107.178.104.10 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
</pre>

<p>Honestly nothing too interesting here, or at least nothing that we haven't seen before.</p>

<p>What is interesting is the fact that the <tt>su</tt> program is being executed but we don't see
any record of that in the <tt>PsTree</tt> output. Normally if the su program were executed to escalate privileges
it would appear in the <tt>PsTree</tt>
output between the two bash shells. But we don't see that here. Something is definitely hinky.</p>


<H1>SPOILERS!</H1>

<p>I hope you had fun with this investigation! There are some unanswered questions, but we're reaching the
limits of Volatility's current capabilities.</p>

<p>I infected this memory image with the "Father" (<a href="https://github.com/mav8557/Father" target=_blank>https://github.com/mav8557/Father</a>) LD_PRELOAD rootkit:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>/usr/lib/libpersist.so.1</tt> is the renamed <tt>rk.so</tt> library
<li><tt>/etc/ld.so.preload</tt> contains the pointer to the rootkit library. <tt>ld.so.preload</tt> is automatically hidden by the Father rootkit
<li>I configured the rootkit to hide all files and directories that start with the string "<tt>qazwsxi</tt>"-- the <tt>xmrig</tt> program is operating from a hidden directory
<li>"<tt>qazwsx</tt>" is also the magic environment variable you set to get the rootkit to escalate your privileges. The <tt>su</tt> program never really executes-- it's the rootkit that's giving me the root shell.
<li><tt>xmrig</tt> and other programs that execute within that shell are automatically hidden by the rootkit
<li>The <tt>xmrig</tt> program is actually just a renamed <tt>ping</tt> binary. As far as I know, <tt>xmrig</tt> has no ICMP tunneling capabilities.
</ul>
