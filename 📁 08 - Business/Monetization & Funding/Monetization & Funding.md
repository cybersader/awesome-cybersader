# Open Source Projects
The goal is to have the ability to show costs for the solution to the users and have them conditionally make up for the costs via one time payments, subscription models, etc.  I've always wondered why there isn't a solution that can transparently and dynamically take the needs of the organization, communicate them to the user, and give them the ability to pay in the ways that they want to.  Lastly, such a solution also needs to operate in a way that doesn't incur costs for the organization facilitating such a system.

# Notes - Looking for Dynamic Subscription Options
## Common Options
For a solution that allows users to transparently see costs and contribute via one-time payments or subscriptions, there are several platforms and methods that might suit your needs:

1. **Open Collective**:
    
    - **Features**: This platform allows communities to collect and spend money transparently. It supports both one-time payments and recurring subscriptions. It provides transparency on how funds are spent, which can build trust with your contributors.
    - **Pricing**: Open Collective has a pricing structure that includes a platform fee and payment processing fee, but it ensures that your organization doesn't have to manage the complexities of financial transactions.
2. **Kickstarter**:
    
    - **Features**: While traditionally used for project funding, Kickstarter can be used to fund specific initiatives or new features. It’s a way to gauge interest and get upfront payments from users who are willing to support your goals.
    - **Pricing**: Kickstarter charges a fee on the funds raised, and it’s generally used for one-time funding rather than ongoing support.
3. **Patreon**:
    
    - **Features**: Patreon allows creators to receive ongoing funding directly from their audience through monthly subscriptions. It’s ideal for creators who regularly produce content or services.
    - **Pricing**: Patreon takes a percentage of the monthly income, and there are different pricing tiers depending on the features you need.
4. **Self-Hosted Solutions**:
    
    - **Features**: For complete control and potentially lower costs, you can consider self-hosting your funding platform. This could be built using tools like WooCommerce (for WordPress) or other e-commerce solutions that support subscriptions and one-time payments.
    - **Costs**: While this might save on platform fees, it could incur costs related to development, maintenance, and payment processing fees.
5. **Crowdfunding Platforms**:
    
    - **Examples**: Platforms like GoFundMe, Indiegogo, or SeedInvest can also be considered for specific projects or larger initiatives.
    - **Pricing**: Each platform has its fee structure, which typically includes a platform fee and a payment processing fee.
6. **Donorbox**:
    
    - **Features**: Donorbox is designed for nonprofits and offers customizable donation forms that can be embedded into your website. It supports both one-time and recurring donations.
    - **Pricing**: Donorbox charges a platform fee plus payment processing fees.

For the specific requirement of not incurring costs for the organization, you may want to:

- **Pass Fees to Users**: Some platforms allow you to pass the transaction fees onto the users, so they cover the costs instead of your organization.
- **Transparent Pricing Models**: Clearly communicate the cost breakdown to users so they understand where their money is going. This transparency can increase willingness to cover additional costs.

If you choose to go the self-hosted route, you can utilize plugins and services that integrate with popular payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal, which can be configured to handle both one-time payments and recurring subscriptions.

## Dynamic Payments
The kind of dynamic, usage-based payment platform you’re looking for is not common, but there are a few services and approaches that come close. These platforms allow for flexible, conditional charging based on user activity or specific triggers. Here are a few potential solutions and approaches:

1. **Usage-Based Billing Platforms**:
    
    - **Stripe**: Stripe offers extensive APIs that can be used to implement custom billing solutions. You can set up metered billing, where users are charged based on their usage. It allows you to define usage thresholds and charge users dynamically based on their consumption.
        - **Documentation**: [Stripe Billing](https://stripe.com/docs/billing)
    - **Zuora**: Zuora provides a comprehensive subscription management platform that supports usage-based billing. It can handle complex pricing models and dynamic billing based on user-defined parameters.
        - **Documentation**: Zuora Billing
2. **Custom Development with Payment Gateways**:
    
    - You could develop a custom solution using a combination of payment gateways (like PayPal, Square, or Stripe) and a backend that monitors user activity. This solution would dynamically calculate the charges based on predefined rules and trigger payments accordingly.
    - **Example Stack**: A backend built with Node.js/Python and a database to track user activity, integrated with Stripe for payment processing.
3. **Flexible Subscription Management**:
    
    - **Chargebee**: Chargebee is a subscription management platform that supports usage-based billing, metered billing, and dynamic pricing. It offers flexible billing rules and can integrate with your existing systems to monitor usage and trigger charges.
        - **Documentation**: [Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/)
4. **Transactional Billing Platforms**:
    
    - **Recurly**: Recurly is another platform that supports subscription billing and can handle transactional billing based on usage. It allows you to create custom billing logic to meet your dynamic pricing needs.
        - **Documentation**: [Recurly](https://recurly.com/)

### Example Use Case
If you want a system where users set a spending limit and are only charged when they use the service up to that limit, you could use Stripe with a custom backend. Here’s a high-level approach:

1. **User Registration**: Users sign up and set their spending limit.
2. **Usage Tracking**: Your system tracks user activity and calculates the corresponding charges.
3. **Billing Logic**: Implement logic to check if the user’s activity falls within their spending limit and only charge them when necessary.
4. **Dynamic Charging**: Use Stripe’s API to dynamically charge users based on their usage.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Set Up Stripe**:
    
    - Create a Stripe account and set up your API keys.
    - Implement Stripe Checkout or Stripe Elements to handle payments.
2. **Backend Development**:
    
    - Set up a backend using a framework like Express (Node.js) or Django (Python).
    - Create endpoints to register users, set spending limits, and track usage.
3. **Usage Monitoring**:
    
    - Implement logic to monitor user activity and calculate charges.
    - Store usage data and spending limits in a database.
4. **Dynamic Billing**:
    
    - Create a billing function that checks user activity against their spending limit and triggers a charge via the Stripe API when necessary.
5. **User Notifications**:
    
    - Notify users of charges and remaining spending limits through email or in-app notifications.

This custom solution would give you the flexibility to charge users dynamically based on their usage and within the limits they set, but it requires development resources to implement and maintain.
