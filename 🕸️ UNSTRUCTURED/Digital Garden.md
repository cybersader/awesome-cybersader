A digital garden is a fluid, ever-evolving knowledge environment that harnesses organizational principles—like taxonomies and ontologies—to support collective or individual knowledge work. Rather than aiming for a polished, static final product, it continuously grows, adapts, and refines its ideas over time, inviting ongoing exploration and discovery.

It can also be seen as a more modern version of scrapbooking when applied to memory illustration or capture.
