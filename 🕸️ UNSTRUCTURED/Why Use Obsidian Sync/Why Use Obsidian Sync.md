[What is stopping you of using Obsidian Sync/Obsidian Publish? : r/ObsidianMD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1cji7ym/what_is_stopping_you_of_using_obsidian/)

I'm going to use it now, but only because Obsidian Sync fills a narrow gap that others wouldn't. In terms of becoming a digital garden, 1GB isn't that much. Granted, you could use Imgur and media hosting plugins to host the beefy data. The one use case I do have for it is as a vault between for my wife and I to share.

- Notion, despite having tons of features, has some weird issues in terms of "information capture" on mobile. Their block-based approach makes bullet list clunky, their most recent update makes it impossible for me to use the Gboard keyboard for voice typing, and not sure I trust the privacy or security there.
- Syncthing + Obsidian - great but it has conflict resolution issues with multiple people and devices if the same vault is open at the same time on multiple devices
