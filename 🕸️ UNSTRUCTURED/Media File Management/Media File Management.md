# GPT

I'm looking for software that can properly do two things: 1) use AI, metadata, and other filename detection to determine the time of picture files or video files via open source or free technology, (examples: auto tagging software, photo organization software) and 2) self hosted and cloud options for storing these photos or even bulk renaming to match time and store for backups or even access like with something such as Google photos or Google drive (examples: NAS device, Google Drive)

Show me options for both using markdown tables along with columns like name, price, open vs proprietary, self hosted vs cloud, features, use cases, market, etc

Use separate tables for 1 and 2 and have at least 10 options in each
