- [ ] Fix this relative path copying issue ðŸ”½ âž• 2024-09-28

Ran into these problems today.  Needed plugins for them.

# The Issue

- I'm using the Commander plugin to activate the "copy file path" Obsidian command to get the relative path of files. Issue being, that it's not working properly for really any file
- The command copies the path of the current file when open, but not from the file context menu of the file explorer in Obsidian

## Current Solution

- Drag the image/file instead
