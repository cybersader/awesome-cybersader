# Empty Lines After Headers?
In Markdown, it is not strictly necessary to have an empty line after a heading, but it is considered good practice for readability and to avoid potential rendering issues with some Markdown parsers. Including an empty line after a heading helps ensure consistent formatting across different platforms and tools. Here is an example with and without an empty line:

### Example with an empty line:
```markdown
# Heading
This is a paragraph following the heading.
```

### Example without an empty line:
```markdown
# Heading
This is a paragraph following the heading.
```

Both examples should render correctly in most Markdown parsers, but using an empty line is generally recommended.
