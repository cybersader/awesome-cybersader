- [ ] Learn how to use RSS ➕ 2024-11-20

RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication, a format used for syndicating online content that allows users to choose the content they want and have it delivered directly to them. It is a standardized way of writing a web feed that enables websites to distribute their content to various platforms. RSS feeds contain headlines and hyperlinks to longer articles, podcasts, or other online content. Users can subscribe to RSS feeds using an RSS reader, also known as an aggregator, which periodically checks for content items in the feeds to which the user subscribes.
