My goal is to help the awesome credit union I work for, help others live in orientation to their goals when using the internet, and to share my talents with others.  

Short term, I'm building a sort of system or stack for sharing knowledge in the cyber community and in organizations in an intuitive way. I'm hoping to present on this topic at WWHF next year...maybe.
