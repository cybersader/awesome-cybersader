**You:**

If I wanted to create a scalable system for storing plaintext files like obsidian git in terms of using git, I need a compostable way to piece together, nest, and link repos.  However, maybe git isn't the best option for this.  Is there a compostable and incredibly scalable way to do this?  I use to GitHub repos to post things but I'm looking for some thing that scales as a backend for a CMS.  Maybe there's a way that plaintext is stored that would scale best.  Am I going about this wrong?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

It‚Äôs not unusual to start with Git for versioned plaintext storage‚Äîtools like Obsidian coupled with Git can feel intuitive at small scales. But as you look toward building a backend for a CMS that can truly scale and remain composable (i.e., easy to piece together, nest, and interlink content from multiple sources), Git alone may start to show its limitations.

**Why Git Alone May Not Scale Well for a CMS Backend**

1. **Large Repositories**: Git‚Äôs performance degrades as repositories grow massive in file count or change history. Large monolithic repos and deep nested submodules become cumbersome to navigate, clone, and maintain.
    
2. **Distributed Composition**: While Git does support submodules or subtrees, these constructs aren‚Äôt always ‚Äúcomposable‚Äù in the sense of dynamically linking many distinct content sources. It often becomes complicated to merge different data sources in a flexible way.
    
3. **Limited Query and Linking Capabilities**: Plain Git doesn‚Äôt provide built-in querying, indexing, or graph-like linking of content. If your CMS needs to quickly find related documents or generate dynamic views, Git by itself offers no direct solution.
    

**Alternative Approaches to Consider**

1. **Content-Addressable Storage (e.g., IPFS)**
    
    - _How it helps_: IPFS and similar content-addressable storage systems store content by hashes, enabling you to reference documents by their content IDs. This makes documents self-describing and linkable, which can be highly composable.
    - _Scalability_: IPFS scales with distributed networks, and content retrieval is global and decentralized. Many nodes can serve the same content, making distribution and scaling more natural.
    - _Structure_: You can build Merkle-DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) of documents, forming a composable ‚Äúweb‚Äù of plaintext nodes that can be easily rearranged and linked without the monolithic overhead of a single Git repository.
2. **Hybrid Approaches: Object Storage + Metadata Layer**
    
    - _How it helps_: Store raw plaintext files in a scalable object store (such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or MinIO on-prem). These systems are designed to handle trillions of objects with elastic scaling.
    - _Versioning_: Many object storage systems support versioning out-of-the-box. You can keep previous versions of documents without manually managing Git histories.
    - _Metadata & Indexing_: Maintain a separate indexing or metadata layer‚Äîcould be a database or a search platform (e.g. Elasticsearch or Postgres with full-text search)‚Äîto handle link relationships, tags, categories, and queries. This separation of concerns provides flexibility and composability.
    - _CMS Backend_: The CMS becomes a layer on top of your storage and metadata index. It fetches the plaintext from object storage and uses the database to quickly resolve links, categories, and nested structures.
3. **Databases and Distributed Version Control Systems Beyond Git**
    
    - _Database-backed Approaches_: Instead of files, use a NoSQL document store (like CouchDB, MongoDB) or even a graph database (Neo4j) if you need rich linking. These databases replicate and scale horizontally quite well.
    - _Versioning in the Database_: Some databases have built-in revision histories (CouchDB‚Äôs revision system), allowing a form of versioning akin to Git, but inherently more composable and scalable as they are built for distributed environments.
    - _Alternate DVCSs_: Systems like Pijul or Fossil are more content- and patch-focused, potentially offering better scaling in certain scenarios than Git. However, these are still version-control tools first, not full CMS backends.
4. **Headless CMS Solutions and Static Site Generators on Steroids**
    
    - _Headless CMS (Contentful, Strapi)_: These platforms are designed to scale content management and often store data in highly scalable databases. They provide rich APIs, which you can layer and link as needed. The underlying storage is typically optimized for large-scale operations.
    - _Jamstack Approaches with a Twist_: You can store Markdown (or other plaintext) in object storage, generate static artifacts, and run builds at scale with a CI/CD pipeline. Add a service to index and link your documents, and you can approach composability in a more dynamic manner than trying to jam everything into one Git repo.

**Strategies for Composability and Linking**

- **Layered Architecture**: Instead of a single tool, think in layers:
    
    - **Storage Layer**: Object store or a distributed file store for raw text.
    - **Indexing/Metadata Layer**: A database or search service that stores references, links, tags, and structure.
    - **Presentation/Integration Layer**: A CMS or a GraphQL layer that composes these documents and relationships into usable content APIs.
    
    Each component can scale independently. Storage can scale by adding more buckets or nodes, indexing can scale horizontally by sharding or clustering, and the CMS layer can spin up more instances as needed.
    
- **Content-Addressing and Hash Linking**: Using hash-based references ensures that linking content remains stable and globally unique. Systems like IPFS inherently use this method, but you can also adopt this idea internally‚Äîstore files keyed by their content hash in object storage, and maintain a lookup table in a database for friendly names, tags, and relationships.
    
- **Graph-based Metadata**: For complex interlinking, a graph database can model content relationships natively. Nodes represent documents, edges represent links or nesting. This makes queries like ‚Äúfind all documents related to X‚Äù or ‚Äútraverse the collection hierarchy‚Äù trivial and fast.
    

**Conclusion**

Relying solely on Git for a scalable, composable CMS backend is often not ideal. While Git is great for version control of code and small doc sets, large-scale content management with rich linking demands a combination of technologies. Consider using a scalable object store or a content-addressable distributed system (like IPFS) for raw text, coupled with a dedicated indexing and metadata service (database, graph store), and then layer a CMS or a headless API on top. This modular approach is more likely to give you the long-term scalability, flexibility, and composability you‚Äôre looking for.

Help me find tech stacks that could support using obsidian at the scale of all Wikipedia pages.  Maybe since obsidian is merely just a plaintext editor with a plugin ecosystem, maybe it's not the best option.  However maybe there's a way to use some backend and point to parts of a large storage system like accessing sets of folders or graphs or nodes that are stored in some decentralized manner?  

Ultimately, you would need an architecture that scales horizontally.

Another issue is that you would have to account for obsidian plugin configs with some global or user config and it switches in certain contexts.  Granted since obsidian just uses .obsidian, then maybe the highest folder up to the root and then switch as you break out of the hierarchy onto another decentralized node.  Is there any sort of decentralized storage systems that could work like this and I could set up a minimum viable solution.  Understand that obsidian really just mounts to some folder and allows you to edit ultimately.  The second piece is some UI for clients to access to decentralized storage network, attach to it with obsidian or somehow synced in their full filesystems or network share, then a system for exploring to network, and a system for storing that network, and maybe a federated system for managing, inviting, and getting nodes onto the network.

Think mastodon but for obsidian vaults

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

If you‚Äôre aiming to scale something akin to an Obsidian vault to the size and complexity of a massive knowledge corpus (e.g., all of Wikipedia) and do so in a decentralized, federated manner, it‚Äôs worth breaking down the problem into distinct layers and considering technologies that can fit each part. We have to remember that Obsidian‚Äôs core strength is its local plaintext editing with a plugin ecosystem, but it‚Äôs not inherently designed to become a fully decentralized, massive-scale platform. To achieve that, you‚Äôll likely need a combination of decentralized storage, synchronization, indexing, identity, and federation protocols‚Äîultimately treating Obsidian as a thin client or optional interface into a much larger distributed system.

### Key Challenges to Address

1. **Massive Content Scale**: Storing and serving millions of plaintext documents (like Wikipedia articles).
2. **Decentralized Storage and Distribution**: Avoiding reliance on a single point of failure or monolithic repo.
3. **Federation and Identity Management**: Allowing multiple nodes (servers, users) to join a network, contribute content, manage permissions, and discover each other, much like Mastodon‚Äôs instance federation.
4. **Indexing and Search**: Providing a way to quickly find and link documents at scale.
5. **Interoperability with Obsidian**: Making the entire distributed dataset appear like a folder or ‚Äúvault‚Äù that Obsidian can browse, edit, and link.

### Potential Architectural Components

**1. Decentralized Storage Layer**

- **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**:
    
    - _What It Provides_: Content-addressed, peer-to-peer storage. Files are deduplicated and given unique hashes.
    - _Why It Fits_: You can store plaintext documents in IPFS and reference them by their content hashes, ensuring global uniqueness. Multiple nodes can pin and serve the same documents, scaling horizontally.
    - _Mounting for Obsidian_: There are FUSE-like integrations or gateways that can mount IPFS directories as if they were local folders, potentially letting Obsidian read and edit them. A specialized Obsidian plugin could facilitate browsing and linking IPFS content seamlessly.
- **Hypercore Protocol / Hyperdrive (Dat Legacy)**:
    
    - _What It Provides_: Append-only logs and distributed file system semantics, allowing for decentralized distribution of datasets.
    - _Why It Fits_: Designed for distributed datasets, versioning, and could scale via swarms of peers. Could form a large ‚Äúvault‚Äù that many nodes maintain and replicate.
- **CRDT-based File Systems (e.g. peritext, or custom solutions with Y.js/Automerge)**:
    
    - _What They Provide_: Conflict-free replicated data types for multi-master editing.
    - _Why It Fits_: If multiple users or nodes are editing documents simultaneously, CRDTs ensure eventual consistency without a central server. This could empower a federation of editors working on the same corpus in real-time.

**2. Indexing and Search**

- **OrbitDB or Textile Threads (on IPFS)**:
    
    - _What They Provide_: Decentralized databases built on IPFS. They can store metadata, indexes, or graphs of documents.
    - _Why It Fits_: You need a way to quickly search through millions of documents. A decentralized database can store indexes (like title-to-hash mappings, link graphs, or full-text search indexes).
- **Graph Databases and CRDT-based Indexes**:
    
    - _Why They Fit_: Obsidian heavily relies on linking between notes. A graph database (possibly one that can be replicated or distributed) would allow you to store and query relationships at scale.
    - _Implementation Detail_: You might keep a replicated graph structure (via CRDTs or IPFS-based DAGs) that defines how documents link together. Users‚Äô clients (or a network of indexing nodes) can maintain and serve these indexes to Obsidian or any other tool.

**3. Federation and Identity**

- **ActivityPub or a Similar Federation Protocol**:
    
    - _What It Provides_: The protocol behind Mastodon, allowing multiple servers (instances) to communicate, share content, and build networks of trust and discovery.
    - _Why It Fits_: If you want a ‚ÄúMastodon for Obsidian vaults,‚Äù you need a federation layer. Each node or community can host a part of the content, advertise its presence, and discover others. Users can ‚Äúfollow‚Äù other vaults, replicate their content locally (pinning in IPFS), and share updates.
    - _Identity and Auth_: Use decentralized identity frameworks (DIDs, domain-based identity, or cryptographic keys) to authenticate users and nodes. Possibly integrate with Web3 identity solutions.
- **User and Plugin Config Management**:
    
    - Since Obsidian relies on `.obsidian` folders for configuration, you could store these configuration files in the same decentralized storage system. Federation means that each node might have its own configuration set, and a user‚Äôs client could merge or select the appropriate config based on the ‚Äúcontext‚Äù or which part of the distributed vault they‚Äôre exploring.
    - Versioned configs can be handled via CRDTs or IPFS forking. Users could ‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù to plugin configurations from certain trusted nodes or instances.

**4. Client UX and Mounting the Distributed Network**

- **Obsidian as a Frontend**:
    
    - Obsidian expects a local folder. You could create a layer that transparently syncs a subset of the distributed content into a local directory. This is like how Mastodon is a frontend to the ActivityPub network‚Äîhere, Obsidian is a frontend to a decentralized content network.
    - A plugin could connect to an IPFS or Hypercore swarm, fetch selected documents, and present them locally. When edits are made, changes are propagated back out to the network.
- **Web-based Portal or Graph Explorer**:
    
    - Provide a web interface (React, Vue, Svelte) that queries the decentralized indexes and displays a massive knowledge graph. Users can find what they need, request their client sync it locally, then edit using Obsidian.
    - The UI could integrate search powered by a decentralized index (OrbitDB full-text search, for instance) so that users can quickly find relevant documents.

**5. Minimum Viable Solution Steps**

- **Step 1: IPFS-backed Storage**:  
    Start by placing a set of plaintext files on IPFS. Use `ipfs mount` or a FUSE layer so your local file system sees the IPFS content as a normal folder. Point Obsidian to that folder. This gets you a decentralized storage backend for a single node.
    
- **Step 2: Add a Distributed Database for Indexing**:  
    Introduce OrbitDB or another IPFS-based database to store metadata like file titles, tags, and links. Obsidian can have a plugin that reads from this database to populate its graph view and jump between notes.
    
- **Step 3: Federation with ActivityPub**:  
    Set up multiple nodes each hosting subsets of the content. Use ActivityPub to allow nodes to discover each other and share pointers (hashes) to new content. This will let you scale horizontally‚Äîmore nodes, more content‚Äîand let users choose which nodes‚Äô content to follow.
    
- **Step 4: Manage User and Plugin Configs**:  
    Treat `.obsidian` folders as objects in IPFS. Each user or node can have its own configuration. Obsidian can detect which ‚Äúnamespace‚Äù or ‚Äúinstance‚Äù you‚Äôre browsing and load the corresponding configuration. Over time, standardize a format for global vs. local configs and store them in the decentralized database layer.
    
- **Step 5: Improve the UX and Performance**:  
    Add caching, local indexing, and optional selective synchronization so users don‚Äôt have to load the entire Wikipedia-scale dataset at once. They can fetch on-demand. Add CRDT-based editing if multi-user concurrency is desired.
    

**Technology Stack Summary**

- **Storage**: IPFS, Hypercore (for decentralized file distribution)
- **Indexing and Querying**: OrbitDB, Textile Threads, or a CRDT-based graph index
- **Federation**: ActivityPub or a custom federation protocol that mimics Mastodon‚Äôs instance model
- **Identity and Auth**: Decentralized identities (DIDs) or cryptographic keys for signing and authorizing changes
- **Client (Obsidian Integration)**:
    - Obsidian plugin to integrate with IPFS-mounted directories
    - A background daemon or service that handles federation, indexing, and synchronization
    - Possibly a web dashboard for browsing the global content network
- **Scalability Approach**: Horizontal scaling comes from adding more peers/nodes that host shards of the data and indexes, each discoverable and linked via ActivityPub or a similar protocol.

* * *

**In Essence:** You can build a ‚ÄúMastodon for Obsidian vaults‚Äù by combining decentralized content storage (IPFS), distributed databases (OrbitDB), federation protocols (ActivityPub), and CRDT-based editing. Obsidian acts as a local interface into a subset of a global, ever-growing knowledge graph. This architecture would let you scale far beyond a single Git repo‚Äôs capabilities, towards a dynamic, federated network that can handle something on the order of all Wikipedia pages, while still preserving the plaintext, link-first approach that Obsidian users love.

Lastly, a system that could hook into a database that scan scale that would allow your filesystem to load things in on demand and cache and store so you  can load from nodes on a network, partials of a folder vertically, and optimize for loading in recursively for files and have control for such

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

What you‚Äôre describing is a dynamic, on-demand, networked filesystem that can scale horizontally, load subsets of huge data structures lazily, cache retrieved data locally, and integrate with a large-scale database or indexing system. Essentially, you want a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù filesystem layer that doesn‚Äôt just blindly serve local content, but fetches data from distributed nodes as needed, stores it locally for performance, and references a scalable backend for metadata and indexing. This would let you navigate, say, a portion of a massive dataset (like a Wikipedia-scale corpus) as if it were a local folder, while actually pulling in data over the network on-demand.

### Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
    
    - **Storage Layer**: A large-scale, distributed object store or content-addressable storage (e.g. IPFS, Amazon S3, Ceph, MinIO) that physically stores the files (plaintext or otherwise).
    - **Indexing/Metadata Layer**: A highly scalable distributed database or key-value store (like CockroachDB, Cassandra, or a specialized decentralized database like OrbitDB on IPFS) that keeps track of directory structures, file locations, hashes, and metadata.
    - **Caching/Local Layer**: A local cache on each client‚Äôs machine or node that fetches files or directories on-demand and stores them for quick repeated access.
    - **Presentation/Filesystem Layer**: A FUSE-based (Filesystem in Userspace) or kernel-level driver that exposes these remote files as if they‚Äôre local. It queries the indexing layer to understand directory layouts and requests file content from the storage layer only when needed.
2. **On-Demand Fetching and Partial Loading**:
    
    - The filesystem layer doesn‚Äôt preload the entire tree. When you `cd` into a directory or request a listing, it queries the metadata store for just that directory‚Äôs entries. It only fetches file contents when you actually open or read the file.
    - This can drastically reduce overhead for massive datasets, as you only load what is accessed.
3. **Caching and Recursive Optimization**:
    
    - Once a file or directory listing is fetched, it‚Äôs stored locally (in memory or on disk) so subsequent accesses are fast.
    - You can implement policies, e.g. prefetching next-level metadata when a directory is opened, or intelligent caching strategies that bring in entire sets of files if you anticipate their use.
    - Time-to-live (TTL) and invalidation strategies ensure that stale data is refreshed from the network when necessary.
4. **Database Integration for Scalability**:
    
    - A distributed SQL database (like CockroachDB) or NoSQL store (like Cassandra) can hold the directory tree structure, file indexes, and metadata (tags, timestamps, hashes).
    - The filesystem driver can quickly fetch directory listings and file metadata via read-only queries to these databases.
    - As the dataset grows, you simply scale out the database cluster, and the system continues to function. Horizontal scaling is achieved by adding more nodes and distributing indexing information.
5. **Decentralized Backends (Optional)**:
    
    - If you want a fully decentralized approach (no central authority), use IPFS for storage and OrbitDB or Textile Threads for metadata.
    - The FUSE layer would:
        1. Query OrbitDB for directory listings and file metadata.
        2. Resolve IPFS CIDs (hashes) for the files you need.
        3. Retrieve files via the IPFS network, caching them locally.
    - This approach scales horizontally as more IPFS nodes join and pin content. The network naturally distributes load.
6. **Federation and Node Management**:
    
    - Much like Mastodon federates user timelines, you can federate file namespaces. Different ‚Äúnodes‚Äù or ‚Äúinstances‚Äù host different subsets of the namespace.
    - The database or metadata layer could be federated: each instance advertises its portions of the dataset. The filesystem driver can consult a DHT (Distributed Hash Table) or an ActivityPub-like federation layer to discover which nodes hold the files or directories you‚Äôre asking for.
    - Authentication and authorization layers can determine which subsets of the filesystem a user can mount. Identity can be managed via cryptographic keys, DIDs, or OAuth-like flows in a federated identity system.
7. **Real-World Analogues and Tools**:
    
    - **CephFS or GlusterFS**: Distributed filesystems that can scale out both capacity and performance. They have metadata servers that handle directory structure and can scale to a point. They‚Äôre more centralized than a fully decentralized solution, but are battle-tested at scale.
    - **S3 + s3fs (or gofuse)**: Mounting an S3 bucket locally via a FUSE driver. While not fully decentralized, it demonstrates how you can load objects on-demand from a large backend. Combine this with a global indexing service and you get closer to what you want.
    - **IPFS + IPFS-FUSE**: IPFS supports mounting via FUSE. By improving the indexing layer (OrbitDB or a custom solution), you can achieve a dynamic, on-demand loading filesystem.
    - **Custom CRDT-based Filesystems**: If you need multi-writer concurrency with no conflicts, integrate a CRDT (Y.js, Automerge) layer that can merge changes seamlessly. This ensures scalability with distributed editing.
8. **Plugin/Client Integration (Obsidian or Others)**:
    
    - From the perspective of an editor like Obsidian, this filesystem just looks like a normal folder. Obsidian will see directories and notes as local files.
    - Obsidian plugins and configurations (like `.obsidian` folders) can also be stored in the distributed filesystem. The indexing layer can specify which configuration files apply in which context. The filesystem layer can map different nodes or directories to different `.obsidian` configurations dynamically.
    - Users can ‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù to particular federated nodes for content and their associated configs, pulling them in on-demand.

### Putting It All Together

**Minimal Viable Approach**:

1. **Start with IPFS + OrbitDB**:  
    Store your files in IPFS. Maintain directory structures and metadata in an OrbitDB database. OrbitDB can be replicated across nodes.  
    Use a FUSE adapter (like `ipfs mount`) to present IPFS content as a filesystem. Extend it with a custom FUSE module that queries OrbitDB for directory listings instead of just relying on IPFS directory objects. This can give you dynamic on-demand loading.
    
2. **Add Caching**:  
    Implement a local caching layer that stores recently accessed directory listings and file blocks on disk for quick repeated access.
    
3. **Federation**:  
    Integrate a federated discovery mechanism (like ActivityPub or a DHT) so multiple IPFS+OrbitDB instances can discover each other‚Äôs data. A user can connect to multiple index databases and mount parts of them side-by-side. Over time, you can grow this into a ‚ÄúMastodon for Filesystems‚Äù model, where you ‚Äúfollow‚Äù certain nodes that host particular datasets.
    
4. **Scaling the Database**:  
    If full decentralization is not required, switch to a scalable distributed database like CockroachDB or Cassandra to hold metadata for billions of files. Your FUSE filesystem queries the DB for directory listings on-demand, and the DB scales horizontally to keep performance stable.
    

### Result

This approach creates a system where:

- **You navigate directories locally**, but behind the scenes, the system only fetches metadata and content as you request it.
- **Caching ensures performance** and reduces repeated fetch costs.
- **Distributed or federated indexing** lets you scale to huge datasets with multiple nodes sharing the load.
- **Obsidian (or any other client)** sees a normal folder, while you seamlessly leverage a global, scalable, and partially loaded dataset.

In essence, you‚Äôre building a layered solution that fuses a scalable database (for metadata/indexing), a distributed object store (for file content), and a custom filesystem (via FUSE) that fetches what you need only when you need it. This ‚Äúon-demand‚Äù and ‚Äúpartial loading‚Äù architecture is key for handling extremely large sets of data without overloading your clients or infrastructure.
