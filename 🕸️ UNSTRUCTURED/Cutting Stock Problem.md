Turns out that it's REALLY HARD to optimize your usage of wood planks for home projects.  This is called the cutting stock problem.

I bought some LVP (luxury vinyl planks - really good for flooring that's resilient) and I wanted to have a good looking pattern while saving wood and accounting for the shape of my floor.  Turns out this problem cannot be cost effectively optimized by normies like myself.
