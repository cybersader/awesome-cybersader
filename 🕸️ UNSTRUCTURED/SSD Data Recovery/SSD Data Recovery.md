# Deleted Data?

- You're likely out of luck because all of the SSD data is usually overwritten by the "TRIM" operation when data is on an SSD.
- This is why forensics on SSDs is usually a dead-end

# SSD Hardware Issue

**You:**

Give me a process for getting an Intel SSD DC SATA to get detected again.  It gets hot when it's plugged in but not getting detected

**ChatGPT:**

Below is a general troubleshooting process you can try to get an Intel DC (Data Center) SATA SSD to be recognized again. Note that if the drive has experienced internal hardware failure, these steps may not restore functionality—but they can help rule out other common issues.

* * *

## 1. Basic Checks

1. **Check Cabling and Power Supply**
    
    - Ensure the SATA power cable and SATA data cable are firmly connected.
    - If possible, test different cables and a different SATA port on the motherboard/backplane.
2. **Check BIOS/UEFI Detection**
    
    - Boot into your system BIOS/UEFI and see if the SSD appears there.
    - Make sure the SATA controller mode is set to a compatible mode (e.g., AHCI or RAID, depending on your configuration).
    - If the drive is not visible in the BIOS/UEFI, continue with further steps.
3. **Test in Another System or With an External Dock**
    
    - Sometimes, trying the SSD in a different PC or a known-working SATA dock can confirm whether the issue is with the SSD or with your original system’s motherboard/power supply.

## 2. Thermal Considerations

1. **Check for Overheating**
    
    - If the drive is getting excessively hot (too hot to touch), power it off and give it time to cool before trying again.
    - Ensure the SSD has adequate airflow. Data center SSDs often expect strong airflow; in a desktop environment, they can get warm quickly without proper cooling.
    - Overheating can cause the drive’s controller to shut down or behave erratically.
2. **Monitor Drive Temperature (If It’s Detected Briefly)**
    
    - If you can see it briefly detected by the OS or a disk tool, monitor the SMART temperature attribute using a tool such as **smartctl** or **Intel MAS** (Intel® Memory and Storage Tool).
    - High temperature can force the SSD into thermal throttle or protection modes.

## 3. Power-Cycle Recovery Attempt

Sometimes, particularly with certain Intel SSD firmware hiccups, a prescribed power-cycle procedure can help the drive recover if it’s stuck in a transient fault state:

1. **Cold Power-Off**
    
    - Disconnect the SATA data cable but leave the SATA power cable connected.
    - Power on the system (with the SSD receiving power but not data) for about 20–30 minutes.
    - Power down the system, disconnect the drive for a minute or two.
2. **Re-Connect Data Cable and Boot**
    
    - Reconnect the SATA data cable, then boot up again to see if the drive is recognized.
    - This may help the SSD’s controller complete any internal recovery routines.
3. **Repeat a Few Times**
    
    - If not recognized the first time, try the above “power on / power off” cycle a couple more times.
    - This procedure can sometimes clear up firmware-related stuck states.

## 4. Use Intel Memory and Storage (MAS) Tool

1. **Download and Install Intel® MAS**
    
    - Intel MAS (formerly known as Intel SSD Data Center Tool or SSD Pro Admin Tool) can be found on Intel’s official website.
    - Install it on a system that can boot to an OS (Windows or Linux).
2. **Scan for Drives**
    
    - Launch the MAS tool and run a scan (`intelmas show drives` in CLI, or the UI equivalent).
    - If the tool can detect the SSD, check the drive’s firmware version, SMART health status, and any error logs.
3. **Update Firmware**
    
    - If the drive is detected, update it to the latest firmware. In some cases, firmware fixes can address detection issues.
4. **Secure Erase or Sanitization (Last Resort)**
    
    - If data on the drive is not critical (or you have backups) and the MAS tool sees the drive, you may attempt a **secure erase** or **sanitize** operation to reset it.
    - This can sometimes restore a semi-corrupted internal state, but it will destroy any data on the SSD.

## 5. Rule Out Physical Defects or Damage

1. **Inspect the SSD Circuit Board**
    
    - Look for signs of burnt components, or a smell of burnt electronics.
    - If you see any obvious physical damage, the drive likely needs professional data recovery or replacement.
2. **Consider Warranty/RMA**
    
    - If the SSD is still under Intel warranty, contact Intel support for an RMA.
    - Provide them with the SSD’s serial number and any diagnostic logs from the MAS tool.

* * *

## 6. Data Recovery (If Needed)

- If the SSD absolutely must be recovered (and you have critical data) and none of the above steps help, you may need the services of a professional data recovery provider.
- Data center SSDs often have sophisticated data encryption and error correction, so typical home “DIY” attempts beyond the above power-cycling and software tools may be ineffective.

## Summary

1. **Check physical connections, BIOS settings, and test the drive in another system.**
2. **Confirm the drive is not overheating** (ensure good airflow, let it cool down).
3. **Attempt a specialized power-cycle routine** that sometimes clears firmware lock-ups.
4. **Use Intel MAS** to check drive health, attempt firmware updates, or perform a secure erase if the drive is recognized.
5. **Inspect for hardware damage** and consider professional data recovery or RMA if the drive remains undetectable.

If the SSD still isn’t recognized after these steps—and you’ve confirmed the cables, power supply, and system BIOS are all functioning correctly—there’s a high likelihood the drive has a hardware failure. In that case, backing up any critical data (if the drive becomes intermittently visible at all) or seeking professional help/RMA is your best path forward.
