**You:**

Should I start collecting CPEs for a future CISSP or is that unnecessary?

**ChatGPT:**

Starting to collect CPEs early can be a good move, especially if you’re certain about pursuing the CISSP. Earning CPEs through webinars, reading materials, or attending relevant security events will build your knowledge and establish habits useful for maintaining the certification later. Plus, some CPEs could benefit other certifications or training requirements along the way, making it a flexible investment. However, if you're still uncertain about CISSP or if it’s a longer-term goal, you could hold off on tracking CPEs specifically until closer to certification.

**You:**

I know, but do they not matter unless I already have one?

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, you're correct! CPEs only start counting _after_ you earn the CISSP certification. So, while gaining knowledge through CISSP-aligned activities is valuable, you won't need to log CPEs specifically for CISSP until you've actually passed the exam and are certified. Until then, just focus on building up your knowledge and skills in areas covered by the CISSP domains, which will set you up well for both the exam and future CPE requirements.
