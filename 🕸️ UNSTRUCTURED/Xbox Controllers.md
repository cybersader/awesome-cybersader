- [ ] Figure out the most cost effective option for Xbox controllers long-term ➕ 2024-11-02

# Defeating Stick Drift

No cap.  I have had 6 separate controllers in the past 2 or 3 years.  These monopolized monsters are made to not last.  You have to be licensed by Microsoft too so there's that issue.

# The Best/Cheapest (Long-Term) Wireless Controller Setup for Xbox

There are actually five different ultimate controllers:
- Ultimate 2.4g
- Ultimate Bluetooth
- Ultimate wired
- Ultimate wired for Xbox
- Ultimate C wired 

Of those only the "Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox" is officially compatible with Xbox.
This is because:
1. Xbox charges a licensing fee, which increases the cost of the controller (the MSRP of the Xbox model is $10 more than the non-xbox wired model).
2. Xbox only licenses wired 3rd party controllers, the only wireless licensed controllers are the 1st party ones.
3. For a controller to be licensed for Xbox, it can't also support other consoles like the Switch.

You need the version that says for Xbox to use it on Xbox.

If you want to use non-Xbox version on Xbox, there are converter adapters you can use like Brook Wingman.

Exactly this! ^

2&3 gives you the ability to instert 8bitdo’s 2.4ghz dongle, that came with your controller. Or you can insert a wired controller.
