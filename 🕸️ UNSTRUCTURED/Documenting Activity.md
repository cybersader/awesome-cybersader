How to Document Activity:

(a) Have a place to publish & a format you're comfortable publishing in:

- Written -- Personal Blog, Medium posts, GitHub, etc.
- Video -- YouTube or another free repository you can aggregate a history of performance.

(b) Choose a lens

Are you looking to:
- Walk someone through something and enable them to repeat your activity?
- Demonstrate your skillset and powerhouse competency?

Each of these have a different lens to them -- one helps someone who didn't know how to do what you've done, while the other exmplifies to a brand that you're a heavier hitter in the marketplace than you were before the video; in the second instance, you don't necessarily need to include the how-to steps but simply the reasoning behind what you did and the outcome you got is what you can document.

(c) Get publishing

Doesn't have to be perfect; it just has to get done.

You clearly know how to record a screencast video --

If you'd rather do video, some ideas could include:

- Post-production voice over.  Watch the video you've recorded, record your voice while watching it to articulate what you've done, then add the track before exporting to publish.
- Being on camera during the screencast recording (or off, if you prefer) and talk through either the steps (if you're making a tutorial) or the highlights and rationale behind why you're doing what you're doing, what you expect the outcome to be, and then -- if you don't get the outcome during the recording, can you articulate why or what happened or troubleshoot?

If you'd rather do written documentation...

Do you have a software you can quickly take screenshots or snippets?

Do you have post-production software that doesn't require an enormous learning curve?

You could add boxes, arrows, and colors to help the end user zero-in on what you want them to see -- especially if you're programming/scripting something or have a nuanced item you want to display.

See attached image for exhibit A.

Hope this helps

Shotcut seemed like one of the easiest video editors to use. I have been actually working on a Python script to automatically overlay text and audio onto screenshots.

I've personally used ScreenPal (formerly Screencast-O-Matic) and Loom. I like to keep it simple.
