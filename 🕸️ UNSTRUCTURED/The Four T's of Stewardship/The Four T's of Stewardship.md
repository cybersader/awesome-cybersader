In Catholic teaching, the concept of stewardship is often summarized by the "Four T's":

1. Time: Offering your time involves dedicating portions of your day to prayer, worship, and service. This could mean participating in parish activities, volunteering for community service, or spending time in personal spiritual growth.
2. Talent: This refers to using your God-given abilities and skills to benefit others. Whether it's singing in the choir, teaching catechism classes, or offering professional expertise to Church projects, sharing your talents helps build up the community.
3. Treasure: This involves the financial support you provide to the Church and charitable causes. Contributing a portion of your income helps sustain the Church's missions, outreach programs, and daily operations.
4. Temple: While not always listed, "Temple" can be the fourth "T," emphasizing the importance of caring for your body as the temple of the Holy Spirit. This means promoting physical well-being and moral integrity in your life.

Sometimes, the fourth "T" is also referred to as "Testimony", which involves sharing your faith and witnessing to others about God's work in your life.

This framework encourages Catholics to recognize that everything they have—their time, talents, treasures, and bodies—are gifts from God. By offering these back to Him and to the service of others, they live out their call to discipleship and stewardship in a holistic way.
