**You:**

What's a simple, pragmatic, and scalable tech stack and processes that can be used for cross-departmental collaboration, task tracking, project management, and a system that exports to formal documentation?

I'm also trying to avoid closed-source or weird cloud-based solutions.  I like Obsidian, but securing it in a corporate setting requires firewall rules to block Obsidian Sync while whitelisting certain GitHub URLs to be used for community plugins that are allowed.  Also, it wouldn't integrate easily or perfectly with an on-prem or even O365 setup.  

When I say scalable, I mean that the wiki/second-brain can double as a place to easily start tasks, manage projects, and more without doing much task switching.  I also want something that can be shared with other teams. 

One solution is to just use a OneNote and put it in a shared Sharepoint library where everyone can access it.  OneDrive is another example here.  However, it's not easy to export documents in a certain formal format like maybe what we could do with a custom Obsidian plugin.

Really, I'm just looking for an intuitive system here.  I want it to be straightforward to other teams and have the same functionality that you would get with a professional cloud-based project management, change management, or company wiki system.

Part of this too is that we want to map things to the NIST CSF 2.0 framework along with crosswalking among other frameworks.  One idea is to have auto-generated pages (maybe with Python) that track related notes and talks to various parts of the heirarchical and cross-walked frameworks.  This would be two-way where we have Excel files with PowerQuery that act like a relational database or we could use a more traditional database like Postgres.  I'm thinking since the IT teams doesn't like new technology that it would be the former.
