# IPv6 Tunneling and NAT

# Don't Buy a Netgear

- The amount of issues I've had thus far after adding a Netgear to [Router IP Passthrough](../../📁%2007%20-%20Cybersader%20Arsenal/Home%20Network/Bridging%20New%20Home%20Router/Bridging%20New%20Home%20Router.md) with my ATT router is frustrating.  I wish it did Bridged, but here we are.  If I could afford a nice Pfsense or Unifi, then I would do it.
