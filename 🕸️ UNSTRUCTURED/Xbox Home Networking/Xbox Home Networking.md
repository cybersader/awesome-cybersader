# IPv6 Tunneling and NAT

- Your parts may jump around a lot.  If you're having party issues, go to Network settings > Advanced and look at alternate port selection.  Make sure that port is open (NAT / firewall rules in your router panel).  Getting to this panel requires you be on your home network, then connect to the likely IP address on the back on your router by typing that IP in your browser to get to the admin panel.

# Don't Buy a Netgear

- The amount of issues I've had thus far after adding a Netgear to [Router IP Passthrough](../../üìÅ%2007%20-%20Cybersader%20Arsenal/Home%20Network/Bridging%20New%20Home%20Router/Bridging%20New%20Home%20Router.md) with my ATT router is frustrating.  I wish it did Bridged, but here we are.  If I could afford a nice Pfsense or Unifi, then I would do it.
