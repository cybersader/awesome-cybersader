**You:**

I'm trying to create a formula for calculating significance.  One of the inputs is a sort of deviation between the calculated risk and AI assessed risk.  The calculated risk comes out from informational, low, medium, high, and critical (1-5).  The AI assessed risk also follows this.  The. I take the difference or deviation between the two and use a formula to generate the significance.  I just need help building this formula.  As the disparity goes up, the score should go up a lot in a multiplicative fashion but I don't want the numbers to matter as much so I think something like a 1.25 or exponent with a fraction could do that.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Also the difference can be negative so I have to take that into account.  I want the ability to tune all of these variables.  I'm not even sure this is a branch of math.  When the difference is negative the number should get smaller and smaller but matter less and less the bigger the difference is.  I'm not sure whether to limit it to never reach zero or not.  Maybe this is a decision that can also be made

**ChatGPT:**

Below is a conceptual approach to building a tunable formula for your significance score, given the difference between the "calculated risk" and the "AI assessed risk." We’ll define:

- **Calculated risk (CR)**: A value from 1 to 5 (1 = informational, 5 = critical).
- **AI assessed risk (AR)**: Also a value from 1 to 5.
- **Difference (d)**: $d = CR - AR$.

The core idea is to have a formula that:

1. Produces a multiplicative growth in significance as the positive difference grows.
2. Produces a diminishing (but never necessarily reaching zero unless desired) significance as the negative difference grows, meaning when the AI risk is higher than the calculated risk, the significance decreases but tapers off.
3. Allows for tuning of how quickly the score grows or diminishes and how sensitive it is to small differences.

### Suggested Functional Form

A good starting point is to use an exponential structure with parameters you can tune:

$$\text{Significance}(d) = \left( 1 + a \cdot |d|^b \right)^{\text{sign}(d)}$$

Here’s what each part does:

- $|d|$: The absolute difference between the two risk assessments.
- $a$: A scale factor controlling how quickly the significance changes per unit of difference.
- $b$: An exponent that controls the curvature. If $b > 1$, differences have a disproportionately larger effect as they grow. If $b < 1$, differences matter less as they get larger.
- $\text{sign}(d)$: This is the sign function:
    - $\text{sign}(d) = 1$ if $d > 0$
    - $\text{sign}(d) = -1$ if $d < 0$
    - $\text{sign}(d) = 0$ if $d = 0$

Thus:

- When $d > 0$ (Calculated risk is higher than AI risk):
    
    $$\text{Significance}(d) = 1 + a \cdot |d|^b$$
    
    As $d$ grows, significance grows multiplicatively (nonlinear if $b \neq 1$).
    
- When $d < 0$ (AI risk is higher than calculated risk):
    
    $$\text{Significance}(d) = \frac{1}{1 + a \cdot |d|^b}$$
    
    As $|d|$ grows large, significance approaches $\frac{1}{\infty} = 0$, but never actually hits zero. If you want to ensure it never gets too close to zero, you could add a small offset or choose smaller $a$.
    
- When $d = 0$:
    
    $$\text{Significance}(0) = (1+0)^{0} = 1$$

### Tuning the Parameters

- **Parameter $a$** (Scale factor):
    
    - If $a$ is large (e.g., 0.5 or 1), a small difference will have a big impact.
    - If $a$ is small (e.g., 0.1), differences will need to be larger before the significance noticeably changes.
- **Parameter $b$** (Exponent):
    
    - If $b > 1$: The effect of difference on significance grows faster than linearly. For example, with $b = 1.25$, going from $|d|=2$ to $|d|=3$ increases the impact more than you’d expect linearly.
    - If $b < 1$: The effect tapers off. This makes large differences matter relatively less (in positive territory) or reduce significance more slowly (in negative territory).

### Example Choices

- Let’s try $a = 0.25$ and $b = 1.25$:
    - If $d = 1$: $\text{Significance}(1) = (1 + 0.25 \cdot 1^{1.25})^1 = 1.25$.
    - If $d = 2$: $\text{Significance}(2) = 1 + 0.25 \cdot 2^{1.25}$. Since $2^{1.25}\approx2.378$, we get $\approx1 + 0.25 \cdot 2.378 = 1 + 0.5945 = 1.5945$.
    - If $d = -1$: $\text{Significance}(-1) = \frac{1}{1 + 0.25 \cdot 1^{1.25}} = \frac{1}{1.25} = 0.8$.
    - If $d = -3$: $\text{Significance}(-3) = \frac{1}{1 + 0.25 \cdot 3^{1.25}}$. $3^{1.25}\approx3^{1.25}\approx4.378$. So this becomes $\frac{1}{1+0.25 \cdot 4.378} = \frac{1}{1+1.0945} \approx \frac{1}{2.0945}\approx0.4777$.

You can see how these parameters affect the growth and decay. Adjusting $a$ and $b$ can help you find the sweet spot.

### Considering Limits or Floors

If you never want the significance to reach zero, that’s already the case—it only asymptotically approaches zero. If you want to ensure a lower bound, you could add a small constant $\epsilon$ inside the formula. For example:

$$\text{Significance}(d) = \frac{1}{1 + a \cdot |d|^b} + \epsilon$$

for negative $d$. Choosing a small $\epsilon$ like 0.1 would mean you never drop below 0.1.

### Summary

- The chosen functional form is flexible and allows for tuning.
- It smoothly handles positive and negative differences.
- By adjusting $a$ and $b$, you can control how sensitive the significance is to deviations.
- You can also introduce a small constant $\epsilon$ if you want a floor for negative differences.

This is not a strict branch of standard mathematics—it's more of a custom scoring function influenced by exponential and polynomial forms. You’re essentially engineering a metric, which is common practice in risk modeling and AI interpretability tasks.

**You:**

How can I put this into a Python function or formula if all I have is those two inputted risks.  Also, like I said, negative differences should make the number small and something like a low going to a critical should make the number bigger.  Include tunable variables

**ChatGPT:**

Here’s how you can create a **Python function** based on the requirements:

1. Inputs: **Calculated Risk (CR)** and **AI Assessed Risk (AR)** (values between 1 and 5).
2. Tunable parameters:
    - `a`: Scale factor for the growth/decay rate.
    - `b`: Exponent to control the curvature.
    - `epsilon`: A small constant to prevent the score from reaching zero.
3. Logic:
    - Positive differences make the score grow multiplicatively.
    - Negative differences make the score smaller, but it never quite reaches zero.

Here’s the function:

```python
def calculate_significance(cr, ar, a=0.25, b=1.25, epsilon=0.1):
    """
    Calculate the significance score based on the difference between
    calculated risk (cr) and AI assessed risk (ar).
    
    Parameters:
    - cr: int, calculated risk (1 to 5)
    - ar: int, AI assessed risk (1 to 5)
    - a: float, scale factor for the growth/decay
    - b: float, exponent for curvature control
    - epsilon: float, small
```

**ChatGPT:**

Below is a Python function that implements the formula and allows you to tune parameters. The formula scales up when the calculated risk (CR) is greater than the AI-assessed risk (AR), and it scales down when the AI-assessed risk is greater than the calculated risk. The magnitude of the difference and the tunable parameters determine how quickly the significance grows or shrinks.

**Key Ideas in the Code:**

- We compute the difference $d = CR - AR$.
- If $d > 0$ (CR > AR), we want a value **greater than 1** that grows nonlinearly with $|d|$.
- If $d < 0$ (CR < AR), we want a value **less than 1** that gets smaller but tapers off and can be controlled.
- If $d = 0$, significance is 1 (no difference).
- Parameters $a$ and $b$ control how sensitive the formula is:
    - $a$ (scale factor): How large an impact each unit of difference has.
    - $b$ (exponent): Controls how the effect scales with the size of the difference.

**Example Formula:**

$$\text{Significance}(d) = (1 + a \cdot |d|^b)^{\text{sign}(d)}$$

- If $d > 0$: $\text{Significance}(d) = 1 + a \cdot |d|^b$
- If $d < 0$: $\text{Significance}(d) = \frac{1}{1 + a \cdot |d|^b}$

**Python Implementation:**

```python
def significance(CR, AR, a=0.25, b=1.25):
    """
    Compute a significance score based on the difference between the
    calculated risk (CR) and the AI-assessed risk (AR).
    
    Parameters:
        CR (int or float): Calculated risk (1-5 scale ideally)
        AR (int or float): AI-assessed risk (1-5 scale ideally)
        a (float): Scale factor controlling how quickly significance changes
        b (float): Exponent controlling nonlinearity of significance changes

    Returns:
        float: A significance value.
               > 1 if CR > AR (signifying more importance),
               < 1 if CR < AR (signifying less importance),
               = 1 if CR == AR.
    """
    d = CR - AR
    if d == 0:
        return 1.0  # No difference => neutral significance
    
    # Calculate the core term:
    factor = 1 + a * (abs(d) ** b)
    
    if d > 0:
        # Positive difference, significance > 1
        return factor
    else:
        # Negative difference, significance < 1
        return 1.0 / factor
```

**Adjusting Parameters:**

- Increase `a` to make the significance more sensitive to differences.
- Increase `b` (>1) if you want the significance to ramp up more quickly as the difference grows.
- Decrease `b` (<1) if you want the significance to grow slower and be less sensitive to larger differences.

**Examples:**

- `significance(5, 1)` with `a=0.25, b=1.25`:
    
    - Difference $d = 4$
    - Significance = $1 + 0.25 \cdot 4^{1.25}$ which will be > 1, indicating a large positive difference.
- `significance(1, 5)` with `a=0.25, b=1.25`:
    
    - Difference $d = -4$
    - Significance = $1 / (1 + 0.25 \cdot |{-4}|^{1.25})$, a number less than 1 and gets smaller as difference grows, but never reaches zero.

By tuning `a` and `b`, you can shape this curve to match your desired behavior.
