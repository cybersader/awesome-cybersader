# Magnetism & Metals

Magnetism in metals and composites depends on their atomic structure and the presence of unpaired electrons. Here's a breakdown to help you identify magnetic and non-magnetic materials for your keyrings:

### **Magnetic Metals**

These metals are ferromagnetic, meaning they are strongly attracted to magnets:

1. **Iron (Fe)** - Highly magnetic and commonly used in steel.
2. **Nickel (Ni)** - Magnetic and used in alloys.
3. **Cobalt (Co)** - Magnetic, though less commonly encountered in everyday items.
4. **Steel** (containing iron) - Most steel alloys are magnetic, especially if they have high iron content. Exceptions include some stainless steels (see below).

### **Non-Magnetic Metals**

These metals are not attracted to magnets:

1. **Aluminum (Al)** - Lightweight and non-magnetic.
2. **Copper (Cu)** - Excellent conductor of electricity but non-magnetic.
3. **Brass** (copper + zinc alloy) - Non-magnetic and corrosion-resistant.
4. **Bronze** (copper + tin alloy) - Non-magnetic and durable.
5. **Stainless Steel (Austenitic)** - Types 304 and 316 are typically non-magnetic due to their higher nickel and chromium content.
6. **Titanium (Ti)** - Non-magnetic and lightweight.
7. **Gold (Au)** - Precious, non-magnetic, and highly resistant to corrosion.
8. **Silver (Ag)** - Non-magnetic and conductive.
9. **Zinc (Zn)** - Non-magnetic and used in galvanization.
10. **Platinum (Pt)** - Non-magnetic, dense, and valuable.

### **Magnetic Composites**

- **Soft Magnetic Materials** - Include iron-based composites used in transformer cores.
- **Hard Magnetic Materials** - Include rare earth magnets like neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) or samarium-cobalt (SmCo).

### **Non-Magnetic Composites**

- Plastics, ceramics, carbon composites, and certain glass materials are non-magnetic by nature.
