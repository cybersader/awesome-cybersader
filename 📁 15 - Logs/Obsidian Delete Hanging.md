- I tried to delete anything in Obsidian and it would freeze
- I thought Obsidian was broke till I opened explorer and the Home folder froze
- I reset the computer which fixed it temporarily, then it came back

- I Ultimately ran commands from here - [Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files-79aa86cb-ca52-166a-92a3-966e85d4094e) 
	- I ran `sfc /scannow` which didn't fix it
	- However, I then ran `DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth` which seems to have fixed it for the time being
- Still hanging

- Guess I'll try the below solutions

- Attempt #1
	- Paste into Terminal > `Run as Administrator` > `del /F /Q %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\*`
	- `del /F /Q %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations\*`
