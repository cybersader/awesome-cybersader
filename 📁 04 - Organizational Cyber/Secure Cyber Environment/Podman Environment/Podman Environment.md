**You:**

I'm trying to set up an environment for cybersecurity-related engineering, automation, and development.  However, I want this environment to be secure and resilient to exploitation or misuse if the device is compromised.  From what I understand, Podman is a good start because it will limit the environment to what my user is only allowed to do.  I'm assuming I can't network things unless I'm allowed to do so as well.  I still need though a way to limit what an attacker can do if they get onto my machine, try to add an additional layer of auth to use Podman on my desktop when I get in and want to use it, have a way to be secure with what containers I get or limit what I can get, and have some general governance on its use.

**ChatGPT:**

Setting up a secure and resilient environment using Podman is a great approach. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieving your goals, including adding additional layers of security and governance:

### 1. Secure Podman Installation and Configuration
1. **Install Podman**: Ensure you have the latest version of Podman installed on your desktop. Follow the official installation guide.
    
2. **Rootless Mode**: Use Podman in rootless mode to enhance security by running containers as a non-root user.
    
3. **Limit Network Capabilities**: Configure Podman to restrict networking capabilities. By default, rootless Podman uses slirp4netns for networking, which isolates the container's network from the host.
    

### 2. Authentication and Authorization
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Implement MFA for logging into your desktop environment. Tools like PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) can be configured for this purpose.
    
2. **Podman Access Control**: Use Linux user groups to control who can run Podman commands. Create a specific group for Podman users and add only trusted users to this group.
    
3. **Additional Auth Layer for Podman**: Consider setting up a secondary authentication mechanism for accessing Podman. This could involve a custom script that prompts for a password or an MFA token before executing Podman commands.
    

### 3. Container Security
1. **Image Source Control**: Use a private container registry that is trusted and secure. This ensures you are pulling images from a controlled and verified source. Examples include:
    
    - Harbor
    - JFrog Artifactory
    - Quay
2. **Image Scanning**: Implement image scanning for vulnerabilities using tools like:
    
    - Clair
    - Trivy
    - Aqua Security
3. **Podman Seccomp Profiles**: Utilize seccomp profiles to limit the system calls that containers can make. This reduces the attack surface by restricting container capabilities.
    
4. **SELinux**: Enable SELinux (or AppArmor on non-SELinux systems) to enforce mandatory access control (MAC) policies, providing an additional layer of security.
    

### 4. Governance and Monitoring
1. **Policies and Procedures**: Develop and enforce policies regarding container usage, including:
    
    - Approved base images
    - Update and patch management
    - Container lifecycle management
2. **Audit Logging**: Enable auditing of Podman commands and container activities. Configure tools like Auditd or use Podmanâ€™s built-in logging capabilities.
    
3. **Monitoring Tools**: Deploy monitoring tools to keep an eye on container activities and potential security events. Prominent tools include:
    
    - Prometheus + Grafana
    - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
    - Sysdig
4. **Regular Security Assessments**: Perform regular security assessments and penetration tests to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
    

### Example Configuration Steps
**Rootless Podman Setup**:

```sh
# Install Podman
sudo apt-get -y install podman

# Run Podman without root privileges
podman info --rootless
```

**Creating a Podman User Group**:

```sh
# Create a new group
sudo groupadd podman-users

# Add your user to the new group
sudo usermod -aG podman-users $USER

# Apply group permissions to Podman
sudo chgrp -R podman-users /usr/bin/podman
sudo chmod 750 /usr/bin/podman
```

**Implementing MFA**:

```sh
# Install PAM MFA module
sudo apt-get -y install libpam-google-authenticator

# Configure PAM to use Google Authenticator for SSH
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/sshd
# Add the following line
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
```

By following these steps and recommendations, you can set up a secure and resilient Podman environment tailored for cybersecurity-related tasks while ensuring governance and limiting the potential impact of any security breaches.

**You:**

Could the image source control, seccomp profiles, and network configuration be limited and governed by admins?  How?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, image source control, seccomp profiles, and network configuration can be limited and governed by administrators. Here's how you can achieve this:

### 1. Image Source Control
**Private Container Registry**:

- **Setup**: Use a private container registry (e.g., Harbor, JFrog Artifactory, Quay) and restrict access to this registry.
- **Access Control**: Only allow trusted users to push images to the registry. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.
- **Whitelisting**: Configure Podman to pull images only from the trusted private registry.

**Example**: Configuring Podman to use a private registry:

```sh
# Login to your private registry
podman login my-private-registry.com

# Pull images from the private registry
podman pull my-private-registry.com/my-image:latest
```

### 2. Seccomp Profiles
**Custom Seccomp Profiles**:

- **Create Profiles**: Administrators can create custom seccomp profiles that define the allowed and denied system calls.
- **Enforce Profiles**: Configure Podman to use these profiles by default for all containers.

**Example**: Using a custom seccomp profile:

```json
{
    "defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO",
    "syscalls": [
        {
            "names": ["execve"],
            "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW"
        }
    ]
}
```

- **Apply the Profile**:

```sh
# Save the profile as custom-seccomp.json
podman run --security-opt seccomp=./custom-seccomp.json my-image
```

**Global Configuration**:

- **System-Wide Configuration**: Place custom seccomp profiles in a directory accessible by Podman and configure Podman to use these profiles by default.

### 3. Network Configuration
**Podman Network Setup**:

- **Network Namespace**: By default, rootless Podman uses slirp4netns, which provides network isolation.
- **Custom Network Configuration**: Administrators can create and manage custom networks and enforce policies for container network usage.

**Example**: Creating and using a custom network:

```sh
# Create a custom network
podman network create my-custom-net

# Run a container using the custom network
podman run --network my-custom-net my-image
```

**Firewall Rules**:

- **Network Policies**: Use firewall rules (e.g., iptables, nftables) to restrict container network access at the host level.
- **Segmentation**: Segment the network to isolate containers from sensitive parts of the infrastructure.

### Governance by Admins
**Centralized Configuration Management**:

- **Configuration Files**: Store seccomp profiles, network configurations, and registry settings in a centralized location (e.g., a configuration management tool like Ansible, Puppet, Chef).
- **Automated Deployment**: Use these tools to automate the deployment and enforcement of security configurations across all systems running Podman.

**Example**: Ansible playbook to enforce Podman configurations:

```yaml
- name: Enforce Podman Configurations
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Copy custom seccomp profile
      copy:
        src: custom-seccomp.json
        dest: /etc/podman/custom-seccomp.json
    - name: Ensure Podman uses the custom seccomp profile by default
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/containers/containers.conf
        line: "seccomp_profile = '/etc/podman/custom-seccomp.json'"
    - name: Create custom Podman network
      command: podman network create my-custom-net
```

**Monitoring and Auditing**:

- **Audit Logs**: Enable and review audit logs for Podman activities.
- **Compliance Checks**: Regularly perform compliance checks to ensure all containers and configurations adhere to security policies.

By centralizing and automating the enforcement of these configurations, administrators can ensure that all Podman environments remain secure and compliant with organizational policies.

**You:**

How would I enforce things for Podman though such as only using the private image source control and networking and seccomp?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To enforce strict controls over Podman configurations such as using only private image sources, specific network settings, and custom seccomp profiles, you can leverage a combination of system configuration files, access controls, and automation tools. Here are detailed steps for each aspect:

### 1. Enforcing Private Image Source Control
**1.1 Configure Podman to Use Only the Private Registry**

Edit the Podman registries configuration to include only your private registry. This can be done by modifying the `registries.conf` file.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/containers/registries.conf
```

Configure it to look like this:

```ini
[registries.search]
registries = ['my-private-registry.com']

[registries.insecure]
registries = []

[registries.block]
registries = ['docker.io', 'quay.io', 'gcr.io']
```

**1.2 Restrict Registry Access**

Ensure that users cannot modify the `registries.conf` file:

```sh
sudo chown root:root /etc/containers/registries.conf
sudo chmod 644 /etc/containers/registries.conf
```

### 2. Enforcing Custom Seccomp Profiles
**2.1 Create a Custom Seccomp Profile**

First, create a custom seccomp profile file, for example `custom-seccomp.json`:

```json
{
  "defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO",
  "syscalls": [
    {
      "names": ["execve", "exit", "exit_group"],
      "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW"
    }
  ]
}
```

**2.2 Configure Podman to Use the Custom Seccomp Profile**

Edit the containers configuration file to enforce the custom seccomp profile by default:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/containers/containers.conf
```

Add or modify the line:

```ini
[containers]
seccomp_profile = "/etc/containers/custom-seccomp.json"
```

**2.3 Protect the Configuration File**

Ensure that users cannot modify this configuration file:

```sh
sudo chown root:root /etc/containers/containers.conf
sudo chmod 644 /etc/containers/containers.conf
```

### 3. Enforcing Custom Network Configuration
**3.1 Create a Custom Podman Network**

Create a custom network for Podman:

```sh
podman network create my-custom-net
```

**3.2 Configure Podman to Use the Custom Network**

Restrict container creation to only use the custom network. One approach is to use system-wide aliases or wrapper scripts.

**Wrapper Script Example**:

Create a wrapper script, `/usr/local/bin/podman-run`, to enforce network usage:

```sh
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/podman-run
```

Add the following content:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
exec /usr/bin/podman run --network my-custom-net "$@"
```

Make the script executable:

```sh
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/podman-run
```

### 4. Governance and Automation
**4.1 Centralized Configuration Management with Ansible**

Create an Ansible playbook to enforce and distribute these settings across all systems.

**Example Ansible Playbook**:

```yaml
- name: Enforce Podman Configurations
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Configure Podman to use only private registry
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/containers/registries.conf
        regexp: '^registries ='
        line: "registries = ['my-private-registry.com']"
      notify: Restart Podman

    - name: Block public registries
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/containers/registries.conf
        regexp: '^registries.block ='
        line: "registries.block = ['docker.io', 'quay.io', 'gcr.io']"
      notify: Restart Podman

    - name: Deploy custom seccomp profile
      copy:
        src: custom-seccomp.json
        dest: /etc/containers/custom-seccomp.json
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0644'

    - name: Enforce custom seccomp profile
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/containers/containers.conf
        regexp: '^seccomp_profile ='
        line: "seccomp_profile = '/etc/containers/custom-seccomp.json'"
      notify: Restart Podman

    - name: Create custom Podman network
      command: podman network create my-custom-net
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Deploy Podman run wrapper script
      copy:
        src: podman-run
        dest: /usr/local/bin/podman-run
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0755'

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Podman
      service:
        name: podman
        state: restarted
```

**4.2 Regular Audits and Compliance Checks**

Set up regular audits to ensure compliance with these policies. You can use tools like Auditd to monitor file changes and command executions.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you can enforce strict controls over Podman usage, ensuring that only trusted image sources are used, network configurations are adhered to, and custom seccomp profiles are enforced. Utilizing automation tools like Ansible helps maintain consistency and compliance across your environment.
