# DROPZONE

- [ ] Make mapping that shows how to map with each framework as the core or a pivoting point 🔼 ➕ 2024-10-05

# Discussions/Opinions Online?

- 

# Database Schema Files?

- Maybe we could define database schema files to keep track of this too?
- 

# Implementation Attempt #1 - Libre Office

## Framework Downloads for Mapping

- Initial Mapping - CSF 2.0
	- CSF Core - https://csrc.nist.gov/extensions/nudp/services/json/csf/download?olirids=all 
		- A taxonomy of high-level cybersecurity outcomes that can help any organization manage its cybersecurity risks.
- CRI Profile
	- https://cyberriskinstitute.org/the-profile/

## Trying it in Libre Calc

- Turns out "LibreBase" is sort of like MS Access and/or PowerQuery
- LibreBase requires a JRE (Java runtime environment) to work
	- https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
- Had to fill down on blanks since this wasn't a "tabular" format - specifically for the CSF Core sheet
	- [How to fill in empty cells with value above - LibreOffice Calc Tutorial - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeVBH0ClCoA)

### Getting Data Out of CRI Community Profile

- The CRI community profile is essentially an implementation example or template that maps the frameworks together and provides a process for RCSA
- The `CRI Profile v2.0 Structure` sheet is probably the best one to help with mapping

### Adding a Control Catalog: NIST 800-53

- [SP 800-53 Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations | CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final)
- [SP 800-53A Rev. 5, Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Information Systems and Organizations | CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/a/r5/final) 
- 

### Curate Security Controls

- List out all of the security controls along with some personal fields/columns/attributes that you want to be attached to them

### Simplifying and Automating the Mapping Process - Relational Database

- There's some options here:
	- Postgres + NocoDB + Excel OR Libre Calc
	- PowerQuery + Excel - not the best idea probably
	- LibreOffice Base + LibreOffice Calc
- A potential solution
	- Map all of the frameworks together with a schema
	- Load in the mapping tables from CRI 2.0, CSF, etc.
	- Make a adjudication table that says which combinations need manual adjudication
	- Have a manual adjudication table that records which individual mappings have been adjudicated
		- Use a form if need be to handle these
	- Have an ultimate mapping table that rolls up mapping components of frameworks as they are related
	- Using something like NocoDB may allow for auto-fill and easier scalability of the process and systems

### Automate the Mapping with Crosswalks/Dimensions (snowflake approach)/Mapping Files

- .

### Integrating with Documentation, Wikis, etc.

- The documentation platform should be able to schedule email alerts on a cadence and features like that
- It's preferred to use a markdown and plaintext based platform. 
- Hook up your documentation platform so that they can be related to your database in some way.
- Hook up your notes and wiki, so that tasks, notes, meetings, and more can also be related to framework mapping components

# Curated Tech Stacks

## 1. OneNote + Sharepoint Excel or CSV

The goal is to be able to map documentation (standards, policies, and procedures) to our framework easily and in scalable fashion.

Some other important aspects:
- Scalable "ticking" - really just the sort of schema to make data entry possible
- Scalable "tying" - be able to link documentation back to the framework or the framework to the documentation
- Can stay updated with the frameworks
- Shareable

Setup:
- Use CSF 2.0 and other framework Excel files and mappings
- Feed the mappings into a Python program that builds out the mapping in OneNote
- Link mappings across wiki pages
- Code Python program to process OneNote pages, based on a decided YAML frontmatter or general headings and format to process the pages and generate a spreadsheet

Without Python (or in the beginning):
- Manually link pages together, but initially generate the OneNote structure

##  (GPT) OneNote + Sharepoint Excel or CSV

If utilizing a full-fledged database system is not feasible, leveraging **Excel or CSV files** as your primary data repository is a practical alternative. You can effectively map SOC activities to multiple frameworks and integrate these mappings with your preferred wiki systems (OneNote, Obsidian, or markdown on network shares). Below, I outline **several approaches** to achieve this with minimal overhead:

### **1. Using CSV/Excel as the Central Data Repository**

#### **a. Organize Your Data Effectively**

- **Structure:** Ensure your CSV/Excel files are well-structured with clear headers. For example:
    - **Controls.csv:** Control ID, Control Name, Description, Frameworks Mapped, Related Threats, Detection Methods, Documentation Links
    - **Threats.csv:** Threat ID, Threat Name, Description, Related Controls, Detection Methods
    - **Detections.csv:** Detection ID, Detection Name, Description, Related Controls, Threats

#### **b. Maintain Consistency**

- **Unique Identifiers:** Use unique IDs for each control, threat, and detection to facilitate linking.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Ensure consistent naming across CSVs to avoid confusion during linking.

* * *

### **2. Integrating with Obsidian**

**Obsidian** is a powerful markdown-based wiki that supports plugins for enhanced functionality. Here's how to integrate CSV data with Obsidian and enable bidirectional linking.

#### **a. Install Essential Plugins**

1. **Dataview Plugin:**
    
    - **Purpose:** Allows querying and displaying data from CSV files directly within Obsidian.
    - **Installation:**
        - Open Obsidian.
        - Go to **Settings > Community plugins > Browse**.
        - Search for **Dataview** and install it.
        - Enable the plugin.
2. **Obsidian CSV Plugin (Optional):**
    
    - **Purpose:** Provides enhanced CSV handling capabilities.
    - **Installation:** Similar to the Dataview plugin.

#### **b. Setting Up Your Vault**

1. **Create a Dedicated Folder:**
    - e.g., `Data/CSV` to store your CSV files.
2. **Add Your CSV Files:**
    - Place your `Controls.csv`, `Threats.csv`, and `Detections.csv` in the designated folder.

#### **c. Querying CSV Data with Dataview**

- **Example Query to List Controls:**
    
    ```markdown
    ```dataview
    table ControlID, ControlName, FrameworksMapped
    from "Data/CSV/Controls.csv"
    ```
    
    ```
    ```
    
- **Linking to Wiki Pages:**
    - In your CSV files, include columns with Obsidian-style links (e.g., `[[Control-123]]`) to create direct links to detailed notes.

#### **d. Creating Bidirectional Links**

1. **From CSV to Obsidian:**
    - **Embed Links in CSV:**
        - In `Controls.csv`, add a column `DocumentationLinks` with Obsidian links to specific notes.
        - Example: `[[Control-123 Documentation]]`
2. **From Obsidian to CSV:**
    - **Link Notes Back to CSV Entries:**
        - In your control documentation notes (e.g., `Control-123 Documentation.md`), include a section that references the control's CSV entry.
        - Example:
            
            ```markdown
            ## Control Details
            - **Control ID:** 123
            - **Mapped Frameworks:** NIST 800-53, CIS Controls
            - **Related Threats:** [[Threat-456]], [[Threat-789]]
            - **Detection Methods:** [[Detection-101]]
            ```
            
    - **Use Dataview to Display Backlinks:**
        - In your CSV-based overview pages, use Dataview to display links to detailed notes.

#### **e. Automating Synchronization (Optional)**

- **Custom Scripts:**
    
    - Use Python or Node.js scripts to automate the creation and updating of markdown files based on CSV changes.
    - **Example Workflow:**
        1. **Detect Changes:** Monitor the CSV files for updates.
        2. **Generate/Update Notes:** Automatically create or update markdown files with links based on CSV data.
        3. **Sync Bidirectional Links:** Ensure that links in both directions are maintained.
- **Tools:**
    
    - **Python with Pandas and Markdown Libraries:** To parse CSV and generate markdown.
    - **Node.js Scripts:** Using libraries like `csv-parser` and `markdown-it`.

#### **f. Example Workflow in Obsidian**

1. **Overview Page:**
    - Use Dataview to list all controls, threats, and detections with links to their respective notes.
2. **Detail Pages:**
    - Each control, threat, or detection has its own markdown file with detailed information and links back to the overview.

* * *

### **3. Integrating with OneNote**

**OneNote** is a versatile note-taking tool within the Microsoft ecosystem. While it doesn't natively support CSV querying like Obsidian, you can still achieve effective integration with bidirectional linking through automation tools.

#### **a. Organize Your Notebooks**

- **Create Sections and Pages:**
    - e.g., Sections for Controls, Threats, Detections.
    - Individual pages for each control, threat, and detection.

#### **b. Use Microsoft Power Automate for Integration**

**Power Automate** (formerly Microsoft Flow) can help bridge CSV data with OneNote.

1. **Set Up Power Automate Flows:**
    
    - **Import CSV Data to OneNote:**
        
        - **Trigger:** When a CSV file is updated in a specific location (e.g., OneDrive, SharePoint).
        - **Action:** Parse the CSV and create/update corresponding OneNote pages.
        - **Example Flow:**
            1. **Trigger:** "When a file is created or modified" in OneDrive.
            2. **Action:** "List rows present in a table" (Excel Online connector).
            3. **Action:** "Create a page in OneNote" with parsed data and links.
    - **Export OneNote Links to CSV:**
        
        - **Trigger:** When a OneNote page is updated.
        - **Action:** Extract links and update the CSV file accordingly.
        - **Note:** This may require custom connectors or using the OneNote API.
2. **Handling Bidirectional Links:**
    
    - **From CSV to OneNote:**
        - Automatically generate links in OneNote pages that reference other OneNote pages or external documentation.
    - **From OneNote to CSV:**
        - Embed links within OneNote pages that point back to CSV entries or related documentation.

#### **c. Manual Linking (Simpler Approach)**

If automation seems complex, consider a semi-automated approach:

- **Embed Links Manually:**
    
    - In your CSV files, include URLs to OneNote pages.
    - In OneNote pages, manually add links back to specific CSV entries or reference sections.
- **Consistent Naming:**
    
    - Use consistent naming conventions to make manual linking straightforward.

#### **d. Example Workflow in OneNote**

1. **CSV to OneNote:**
    - When `Controls.csv` is updated, Power Automate creates or updates corresponding OneNote pages with control details and links.
2. **OneNote to CSV:**
    - Links within OneNote pages reference specific controls, which are also listed in `Controls.csv`, maintaining consistency.

* * *

### **4. Integrating with Markdown on Network Shares**

Using markdown files stored on network shares offers flexibility and simplicity. Here's how to set up bidirectional linking using CSV/Excel as your data source.

#### **a. Organize Your Markdown Files**

- **Folder Structure:**
    - `Documentation/Controls/Control-123.md`
    - `Documentation/Threats/Threat-456.md`
    - `Documentation/Detections/Detection-789.md`

#### **b. Use a Markdown Editor or Static Site Generator**

- **Editors:** Use any markdown editor like VSCode, Atom, or dedicated tools.
- **Static Site Generators (Optional):** Tools like **MkDocs** or **Jekyll** can help create a browsable documentation site from markdown files.

#### **c. Automate Link Generation**

1. **Scripts for Synchronization:**
    
    - **Python or Bash Scripts:** To read CSV files and generate/update markdown files with appropriate links.
    - **Example Script Workflow:**
        1. **Read CSV Files:** Parse `Controls.csv`, `Threats.csv`, etc.
        2. **Generate Markdown Files:** Create or update markdown files with control details and links.
        3. **Insert Links:**
            - In `Control-123.md`, add links to related threats and detections.
            - In `Threat-456.md`, link back to related controls.
2. **Bidirectional Linking Logic:**
    
    - Ensure that when a control links to a threat, the threat's markdown file also links back to the control.

#### **d. Accessing Markdown Files from Wiki Pages**

- **Hyperlinks:**
    - Use relative or absolute paths in your wiki pages to link to markdown files.
    - Example:
        
        ```markdown
        [Control 123](./Documentation/Controls/Control-123.md)
        ```
        
- **Embedded Content:**
    - Some wiki systems allow embedding markdown content directly from files.

#### **e. Example Workflow for Markdown on Network Shares**

1. **Central CSV File:**
    - Maintain `Controls.csv` as the source of truth.
2. **Run Synchronization Scripts:**
    - Periodically run scripts to update markdown files based on CSV data.
3. **Maintain Links:**
    - Scripts ensure that links within markdown files are consistently updated to reflect relationships.
4. **Access via Wiki:**
    - Use network share paths or integrate with your existing documentation system to reference markdown files.

* * *

### **5. Achieving Bidirectional Linking**

Bidirectional linking ensures that references are maintained both from the CSV/Excel data to the wiki pages and vice versa. Here's how to implement it effectively:

#### **a. From CSV to Wiki**

- **Embedding Links:**
    - Include links to wiki pages within your CSV entries.
    - Example in `Controls.csv`:
        
        | ControlID | ControlName | DocumentationLinks |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | 123 | Access Control | [[Control-123 Documentation]] |
        

#### **b. From Wiki to CSV**

- **Referencing CSV Data:**
    - In your wiki pages, include links back to the CSV entries.
    - **Obsidian Example:**
        
        ```markdown
        ## Control Details
        - **Control ID:** 123
        - **Documentation Source:** [Controls.csv](../Data/CSV/Controls.csv#control-123)
        ```
        
    - **OneNote Example:**
        
        ```markdown
        ## Control Details
        - **Control ID:** 123
        - **Source CSV:** [Controls.csv#123](path_to_csv#123)
        ```
        
    - **Markdown on Network Shares:**
        
        ```markdown
        ## Control Details
        - **Control ID:** 123
        - **Source CSV:** [Controls.csv](../../Data/Controls.csv#123)
        ```
        

#### **c. Automate Bidirectional Links (Advanced)**

- **Scripts to Maintain Links:**
    
    - Develop scripts that ensure any new link added in the CSV is reflected in the wiki and vice versa.
    - **Example:**
        1. **When a new control is added to `Controls.csv`,** the script creates a corresponding wiki page with links to related threats and detections.
        2. **When a link is added in the wiki page,** the script updates the CSV to reflect this relationship.
- **Use Version Control:**
    
    - Store CSV and markdown files in a Git repository to track changes and ensure consistency.

* * *

### **6. Leveraging OSCAL with CSV and Wiki Integration**

**OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language)** is a standard for representing security controls in a machine-readable format. Integrating OSCAL with your CSV and wiki setup can enhance interoperability and automation.

#### **a. Convert CSV to OSCAL**

- **Use Tools or Scripts:**
    - Develop scripts to transform your CSV data into OSCAL-compliant JSON or XML files.
    - **Python Example:**
        
        ```python
        import csv
        import json
        
        with open('Controls.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
            reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
            controls = []
            for row in reader:
                control = {
                    "id": row['ControlID'],
                    "title": row['ControlName'],
                    "description": row['Description'],
                    "relatedFrameworks": row['FrameworksMapped'].split(','),
                    "relatedThreats": row['RelatedThreats'].split(','),
                    "detectionMethods": row['DetectionMethods'].split(',')
                }
                controls.append(control)
        
        oscal = {
            "metadata": {
                "title": "SOC Framework Mapping",
                "version": "1.0"
            },
            "controls": controls
        }
        
        with open('controls.oscal.json', 'w') as jsonfile:
            json.dump(oscal, jsonfile, indent=2)
        ```
        

#### **b. Utilize OSCAL in Your Workflow**

- **Import OSCAL into GRC Tools (If Applicable):**
    
    - If you decide to use a GRC tool later, OSCAL files can be imported for standardized control representation.
- **Link OSCAL Data with Wiki:**
    
    - Store OSCAL files in your documentation repository.
    - Reference OSCAL components in your wiki pages for detailed compliance information.

#### **c. Automate OSCAL Updates**

- **Scripts to Keep OSCAL in Sync:**
    - Ensure that any changes in CSV/Excel are automatically reflected in OSCAL files.
    - Use the same scripts that handle CSV to markdown synchronization to also update OSCAL files.

* * *

### **7. Best Practices for Minimal Overhead Integration**

To maintain a low-overhead system while ensuring effective mapping and bidirectional linking, follow these best practices:

#### **a. Automate Wherever Possible**

# Framework Mapping Tech Stack Approach

**You:**

Could you help me understand control, threat, attack, detection, and general framework mapping when it comes to thing like NIST 800-53.  I want to be able to map everything I do in the SOC to such frameworks but I find it hard to get a manageable and scalable system going that doesn't involve a bunch of ticking and typing in massive spreadsheets.  Preferably, we would have a really good database tool with a frontend UI geared towards this work.  Also, it would ideally map to CIS controls, NIST CSF 2.0, could use OSCAL, and really just all around map to other frameworks and fit in with our wiki and documentation.  I'm having trouble with figuring out such a system.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! Mapping SOC (Security Operations Center) activities to comprehensive frameworks like NIST 800-53, CIS Controls, NIST CSF 2.0, and OSCAL can seem daunting initially. However, with a structured approach and the right tools, you can create a scalable and manageable system that minimizes reliance on cumbersome spreadsheets. Below, I’ll break down the key components and provide guidance on establishing an effective mapping system.

* * *

## **1. Understanding the Core Concepts**

### **a. Controls**

- **Definition:** Security controls are safeguards or countermeasures to avoid, detect, counteract, or minimize security risks.
- **Example:** NIST 800-53 provides a catalog of security controls across various families like Access Control, Incident Response, etc.

### **b. Threats and Attacks**

- **Threats:** Potential causes of unwanted incidents (e.g., malware, phishing).
- **Attacks:** Specific actions taken to exploit vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, DDoS).

### **c. Detection**

- **Definition:** Mechanisms and processes to identify the occurrence of a threat or attack.
- **Example:** Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) alerts.

### **d. General Framework Mapping**

- **Purpose:** Aligning your SOC activities and security measures with standardized frameworks to ensure comprehensive coverage, compliance, and best practices.

* * *

## **2. Establishing a Mapping Framework**

### **a. Define Your Objectives**

- **Compliance:** Ensure adherence to regulatory requirements.
- **Risk Management:** Identify and mitigate risks effectively.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Streamline SOC processes for better performance.

### **b. Choose a Centralized Database Tool**

- **Procedure:**
    
    1. Organize your markdown files in a structured folder hierarchy.
    2. In your main mapping CSV, include file paths or relative links to specific markdown documents.
    3. Use relative paths to maintain portability across different environments.
- **Example Link:**
    
    ```markdown
    [Access Control Policy](./policies/access_control_policy.md)
    ```
    
- **Advantages:**
    
    - Easy to manage and update documentation.
    - Compatible with various markdown-based wiki tools like Obsidian.

#### **ii. Synchronization with Obsidian:**

- **Procedure:**
    
    - If using Obsidian, ensure the network share is synchronized with your Obsidian vault, either directly or via a syncing tool (e.g., Syncthing, Dropbox).
- **Advantages:**
    
    - Real-time access and updates across different devices and team members.
    - Centralized storage with distributed access.

## **3. Automating the Integration**

To minimize manual effort and ensure consistency between your Excel/CSV mappings and your wiki documentation, consider implementing some level of automation.

### **a. **Using Zapier or Microsoft Power Automate**

These automation platforms can help bridge your Excel/CSV data with your wiki systems.

#### **i. Zapier:**

- **Use Cases:**
    
    - **Trigger:** When a new row is added or updated in Excel/CSV.
    - **Action:** Create or update a page in OneNote or Obsidian via API or compatible integrations.
- **Setup:**
    
    1. **Connect Excel to Zapier:**
        - Choose **Microsoft Excel** as the trigger app.
        - Set the trigger event (e.g., **New Row** or **Updated Row**).
    2. ## **Connect to OneNote:**
