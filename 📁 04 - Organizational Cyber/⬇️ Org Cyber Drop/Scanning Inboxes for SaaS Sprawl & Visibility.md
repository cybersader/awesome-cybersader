# Using Email Search - Personal Usage
- By searching for terms like “Welcome,” “Sign Up,” “Verify Your Account,” or “Subscription,” you can unearth emails from various services you’ve subscribed to over the years.

# Extreme Personal Options
Purchase lists (available underground) of account/e-mail associations.
Purchase lists (available aboveground) of account/e-mail associations.
Many services provided a searchable directory to subscribers which can be used to determine if an e-mail address has an associated account.
Serve subpoenas on service providers to get information on a specified e-mail address.
Many people post their e-mail/account information socially, where it can be queried using a search engine.
Many services validate, during account creation, any supplied e-mail address, so logs can be examined on the e-mail system to determine account/e-mail associations.
The owner of the accounts associated with a given e-mail address can be queried directly.
Security cameras, key logging, vulnerable services on the client machine that leak data… sometimes these areas allow for discovery of account/e-mail association.
