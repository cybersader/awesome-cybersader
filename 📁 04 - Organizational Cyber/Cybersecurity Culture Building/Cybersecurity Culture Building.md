- Gamifying projects?
	- For a long-term project like data governance, you could break it down into smaller, manageable tasks or milestones and then create a points system for completing each task.
	- Additionally, setting up team-based challenges can encourage collaboration and collective effort towards the larger goal.
- Maybe not. I think I'm more trying to think about how this would actually look concretely. How would I track these things? Would I need full-time employment like FTE, like a full job to gamify this stuff? I want this to be low-cost, high- benefit.
	- It sounds like you're trying to balance effective implementation with resource constraints. You want something that’s engaging but doesn't require a lot of overhead or additional full-time staff.
	- One way to manage this could be using existing project management and collaboration tools. Tools like Trello, Asana, or even Microsoft Teams can help track progress and assign points or badges for completed tasks. You can set up a system where milestones are recorded, and achievements are celebrated within these platforms.
	- To keep costs low, you could form a small cross-functional team to oversee the initiative part-time, perhaps with representatives from different departments. This way, the responsibility is shared, and it doesn't fall on a single person.
	- For tracking and leaderboards, you could use a shared spreadsheet or an existing project management tool. Many of these tools have features for tracking progress and displaying results in an engaging way.
- Gamified custom assessments, forms, questionnaires and quizzes
