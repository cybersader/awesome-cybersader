# Using Powershell

You essentially need to get an account for these exports that the sysadmin would have.

**You:**

How can I get CSVs that show the inheritance structure and permissions for users?  What am I even looking for?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To capture the inheritance structure and permissions in Active Directory (AD) into CSV files, you‚Äôll need to extract information about permissions, inheritance, and effective permissions for users or groups. Here‚Äôs how to approach this:

### 1. **Tools and Commands to Export Permissions and Inheritance**

- **PowerShell**: AD provides powerful cmdlets for managing and retrieving permissions data. Specifically, PowerShell cmdlets can list Access Control Entries (ACEs) for each file or folder.
- **Tools like DSACLS**: The `dsacls` command-line tool can be useful for exporting permissions and inheritance for directories.

### 2. **PowerShell for Gathering Permissions and Inheritance Data**

PowerShell‚Äôs `Get-Acl` cmdlet is effective for retrieving permissions and inheritance information from folders. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown:

```powershell
# Example to retrieve permissions for a folder path and its subfolders.
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\path\to\departments" -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
    $acl = Get-Acl $_.FullName
    $acl.Access | ForEach-Object {
        [PSCustomObject]@{
            Path          = $_.Path
            Identity      = $_.IdentityReference
            AccessType    = $_.AccessControlType
            Permission    = $_.FileSystemRights
            IsInherited   = $_.IsInherited
            InheritanceFlags = $_.InheritanceFlags
            PropagationFlags = $_.PropagationFlags
        }
    }
} | Export-Csv -Path "C:\path\to\permissions_export.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

- **Explanation**:
    - `Path`: Full path of the folder/file.
    - `Identity`: User or group assigned the permission.
    - `AccessType`: Whether the permission is Allow or Deny.
    - `Permission`: Specific permissions (e.g., Read, Write).
    - `IsInherited`: Indicates if the permission is inherited from a parent folder.
    - `InheritanceFlags` and `PropagationFlags`: Flags that specify how inheritance is applied (e.g., to subfolders only).

### 3. **Inspecting CSV Data for Inheritance and Effective Permissions**

Once you‚Äôve exported this data:

- **Look for `IsInherited` Values**: These show if permissions on a folder are inherited or explicitly set.
- **Trace Paths for Parent-Child Relationships**: By sorting or grouping by path, you can view the hierarchy and see how permissions are inherited at each level.
- **Analyze `Identity` and `Permission` Fields**: Check if users or groups have permission on a specific path due to inheritance or explicit assignment.

### 4. **Creating a CSV for Effective Permissions**

Effective permissions can be challenging to calculate directly in AD, especially when inheritance and multiple group memberships come into play. A script like the one above will help, but you may need a dedicated permission analysis tool if you need more comprehensive reports, such as those provided by:

- **NTFS Permissions Reporter**: This tool offers a graphical and CSV export option, showing explicit and inherited permissions.
- **AD Security Tools**: Third-party tools (e.g., SolarWinds Access Rights Manager, ManageEngine ADManager) can generate reports on effective permissions across AD.

Using the output from PowerShell or one of these tools, you‚Äôll have a structured view of folder permissions, inheritance, and any unique assignments, which can be critical for mapping out the AD permission structure effectively. Let me know if you'd like help fine-tuning the script or analyzing the CSV output!

**You:**  

With AD or the Graph API (im not sure which ones I can use since we're on prem), can I get the data points of File Server, Access Path, User/Group, and Permission source data such as inheritance and context for it?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Since you‚Äôre on-premises with AD, you can gather permissions data directly from your File Server or Active Directory using PowerShell scripts, as well as some available APIs. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how you can get each data point:

### 1. **File Server (Server Context)**

- **PowerShell**: Using `Get-ChildItem` with `Get-Acl`, you can retrieve information about the file server path and server context (e.g., which server or file share the data resides on).
- **Example**:
    
    ```powershell
    $fileServer = "FileServerName" # Replace with your file server name
    Get-ChildItem -Path "\\$fileServer\sharedfolder" -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
        $acl = Get-Acl $_.FullName
        [PSCustomObject]@{
            FileServer = $fileServer
            AccessPath = $_.FullName
            UserOrGroup = ($acl.Access | ForEach-Object { $_.IdentityReference })
        }
    } | Export-Csv -Path "C:\path\to\file_permissions.csv" -NoTypeInformation
    ```
    
- This example retrieves `FileServer`, `AccessPath`, and `UserOrGroup` and outputs them to a CSV.

### 2. **Access Path**

- **PowerShell**: The `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet allows you to specify the access path for each directory, which is also reflected in `AccessPath` in the example above.
- **Recursive Queries**: By using the `-Recurse` parameter, you can get the access path for each folder and file within a given directory.

### 3. **User/Group Permissions**

- **Get-Acl and Parsing Access Control Entries (ACEs)**: Each ACE within an ACL provides user/group-specific permissions. The `Access` property contains information about each ACE, such as:
    - `IdentityReference`: Shows the user or group.
    - `FileSystemRights`: Lists the specific permissions (e.g., Read, Write).
- **Example to Add Permissions to the CSV**:
    
    ```powershell
    Get-ChildItem -Path "\\$fileServer\sharedfolder" -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
        $acl = Get-Acl $_.FullName
        $acl.Access | ForEach-Object {
            [PSCustomObject]@{
                FileServer      = $fileServer
                AccessPath      = $_.Path
                UserOrGroup     = $_.IdentityReference
                Permissions     = $_.FileSystemRights
                AccessType      = $_.AccessControlType
                IsInherited     = $_.IsInherited
                InheritanceSource = if ($_.IsInherited) { "Parent Folder" } else { "Explicit" }
            }
        }
    } | Export-Csv -Path "C:\path\to\user_permissions.csv" -NoTypeInformation
    ```
    

### 4. **Permission Source Data (Inheritance Context)**

- **Inheritance Properties**: `IsInherited`, `InheritanceFlags`, and `PropagationFlags` provide inheritance context.
    
    - **IsInherited**: Shows if the permissions are inherited.
    - **InheritanceFlags**: Specifies inheritance conditions, like if permissions are applied to subfolders.
    - **PropagationFlags**: Controls whether inheritance applies to objects within the folder or just the folder itself.
- **Permissions Inheritance Example**:
    
    - To see which permissions are inherited from a parent folder vs. set explicitly:
        
        ```powershell
        $fileServer = "FileServerName"
        Get-ChildItem -Path "\\$fileServer\sharedfolder" -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
            $acl = Get-Acl $_.FullName
            $acl.Access | ForEach-Object {
                [PSCustomObject]@{
                    FileServer          = $fileServer
                    AccessPath          = $_.Path
                    UserOrGroup         = $_.IdentityReference
                    Permissions         = $_.FileSystemRights
                    AccessType          = $_.AccessControlType
                    IsInherited         = $_.IsInherited
                    InheritanceFlags    = $_.InheritanceFlags
                    PropagationFlags    = $_.PropagationFlags
                    InheritanceSource   = if ($_.IsInherited) { "Parent Folder" } else { "Explicit" }
                }
            }
        } | Export-Csv -Path "C:\path\to\permissions_inheritance.csv" -NoTypeInformation
        ```
        

### Summary of CSV Data Points Collected:

- **FileServer**: Name of the file server (manually specified).
- **AccessPath**: Full path to the directory or file.
- **UserOrGroup**: Identity to which the permission applies.
- **Permissions**: Specific permissions granted (e.g., Read, Write).
- **AccessType**: Allow or Deny.
- **IsInherited**: Whether the permission is inherited from a parent directory.
- **InheritanceFlags** and **PropagationFlags**: Define inheritance rules and contexts.
- **InheritanceSource**: Shows whether the permission source is from the parent folder or explicitly assigned.

This approach provides detailed inheritance and permissions context, allowing you to analyze and understand effective permissions across your File Server. Let me know if you need further help refining the script or structuring the CSV data.
