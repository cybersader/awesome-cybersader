- Icebreak
    - Who's highschool
    - Who's college
- I'm going to set a goal here
    - For every presentation slide, I need someone to comment or ask a question
- My background
    - Diver and cheerleader in highschool
    - Played video games here and there.
    - My dad is the tech dad and in cybersecurity, so I talked about it all the time
- How do you picture IT people?
    - IT arrogance word cloud
    - We all have our hobbies…emphasis on hobbies
    - Askers anyone?
    - Takers?
    - Reaction meme
- IT meme “why don't you use ____”

    - I'm not here to do that
    - But here to tell you why you should care and why it will help you with your individual goals, family goals, and business goals
- Cyber origin
    - Kaiber
    - To sail
    - Explore cyberspace and information
    - But don't let the waves just take you
- I was in Hawaii and almost got killed by a wave because I ignored the lifeguard…true story
- I also became a lifeguard the next summer
- So why care….why?
- Who's got nothing to hide?
    - Be honest
    - What is someone going to use from you?
- I've got one
    - How about your future
- What does social media sell?
    - The imperceptible change in human behavior
    - Don't boil the frog too fast
- I'm the crazy guy now…
    - Show the crazy IT person or conspiracy theory lover
    - …No I'm not
- Who here has goals?
    - Oh crap…that's a deep question.
    - If you have goals, then you have to care and here's why
- The philosophy of cybersecurity and privacy
    - Show the definitions
- What are the goals of TikTok?
    - How does it get there?
    - What are the means to its end?
    - Show the engine
    - TikTok is awesome like casinos are or anything big and world changing
- We can use it our way though and make a change
    - Just like casinos have card counters, we can hack the system in a way that's not unethical or immoral
- What are your goals, or your financial dreams even for those primary goals

    - Are these things getting you there?
- What have you got to hide
    - You might say ssn or my face and all this - mostly cyber
    - Why does my likes matter? Or my preferences
    - Because huge data analytics companies can use that data on a very large scale and you can't be sure that it aligns with your goals/values. That's why privacy matters
- Show patchwork of privacy laws in the US and abroad
    - This is gonna take some work.
    - You can argue there needs to be boundaries here for the companies that can utilize large volumes of it and pass a profit margin threshold with it. Only a small number of companies that can turn the dial on this stuff
- That's the privacy stuff

- Cybersecurity stuff
    - It's about exploiting technology and systems
- By nature technology and systems are abstract and so it's not like highschool and college students can make a big dent.

- However, you want to be protected and make a difference still so here's how
- I'm one guy in a company of 400…how do we do it? It's hard by nature. We have to secure complex things that we don't understand and specialized teams of hackers try to thwart that, so we have to rely on security by design
- The proven parts of security are done with mostly math because you can prove it with a formula
- It all still relates to identity because that relates to interests and game theory
- So we get good at building walls and checking the people that walk through them
