	- The first guy I skateboarded and played baseball with.  The person driving was distracted and didn't notice the stop sign and approaching vehicles.
	- The other one went nearly head-on into a telephone pole.  The person in that passenger seat was a closer friend.

- Talking about abstractions all the time is boring
	- Show clips of annoying IT people
	- Intellectual arrogance
	- FUD
	- How stuff is "coded" and designed in the background can be exploited by hackers, but that's the responsibility of the designers of those systems.
	- Talking to you about how all of that is secured is boring. 
	- Rather, I want to arm the masses so they can navigate all of this no matter what it is.
- How do you picture IT people?
    - IT arrogance word cloud

    - Takers?
    - Reaction meme
- IT meme “why don't you use ____”
    - I'm not here to do that
    - But here to tell you why you should care and why it will help you with your individual goals, family goals, and business goals

- I've been exploring the internet for the past 20 years and in the IT field for the past 5.

- There are 2 focuses today:
	- 1. Why this matters
	- 2. What you do

# 3. Why it Matters

- How do we actually look at cyberspace?

- 5 years ago, I was in Hawaii.  I was with the swim and dive team.  Hawaii is awesome, but some awesome things can come with there dangers.  I was swimming past the break point of the waves and it was winter season.  The waves don't look so bad from far away.  I was on a particular beach where the sand slopes up much faster.  Some of them nicknamed it breakneck beach in the winter.  The waves were around 15 feet tall when they crested on the shore.  We would swim past them and chill out before where they crest.  At one point, the lifeguard told us we had a big "set" coming in.  I was swimming in as fast as I could, but I wasn't too scared at the time.  I looked back and the wave was likely a good 20+ ft tall from top to the sand.  I was in the middle of it.  I relaxed and let the wave throw me around and that happened for about 15+ seconds.  I got thrown around hard and tried to get my head out of the water knowing that the wave was over.  Unfortunately, I could only get my head out to barely see that another comparable wave was over me again.  This time I hit the sand and it hurt like crazy almost taking the wind out of me.  I got thrown around yet again.  Yet another wave, but this time I got a slight breath in.  I was under the water for over a minute.  I saw a lifeguard waiting with his flotation device ready to run in a get me.  He told me that is was a wave hold down for 3 or 4 waves.  

- It's all fun and games till the waves build up to be too big and you don't take it seriously.

## Cyber Origin

- [cybernetics | Etymology of cybernetics by etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/word/cybernetics)
- 

- Cyberspace comes from a novel in the 80s.  It was a supposedly meaningless term made up by the author, but it had a word it came from.  Kybernan.
- It means to steer or control.  So cyber really refers to the space of digital information.  Cyber can be thought of as an ocean or a landscape of information.  We can navigate it and it has no borders, factions, peoples, and many dangers.

- Security comes from the idea of peace of mind.  From what is the question.  Cybersecurity is peace of mind in navigating the internet and it's technologies.  Privacy is freedom from intrusion in terms of being secluded.  So really data privacy is all about being able to leave out your data.  This is only an issue in the information age.

- The broader picture here is actually a lot simpler and it applies at all times.  

- You can see these as game theory.  We have entities or agents and those agents have interests or goals.  Some are even opposed to our own.  

- In soccer, both sides have a goal, but they are naturally opposed or conflicting.  Getting one goes against the other.  

- Here's the best definition then for cybersecurity and data privacy - give definitions 

- We can see this play out at every scale.

# 4. Game Theory & Goals

- Cyberwar - government
- IT infrastructure and system design - businesses
- Data usage - businesses
- Technology use and data exposure - families, individuals

- Government/nation state
- Business/entity level
- Families, individuals

- Why should you care?  It depends on your interests.  The reason we have a constitution in the first place is because the majority isn't always right and we have to have something stronger as a foundation.  This foundation should have the interests of the people in mind.  In this case, life liberty and the pursuit of happiness (whatever that means).  

- Hopefully, it's at some level of self actualization.

- Ask yourself what your goals actually are.

- This is called the alignment problem.  One great issue is that the constitution could not have accounted for the things we have today.

- So what does everyone tell you to worry about: the news is desensitizing.  

- As businesses, we build the large scale tools to reach our goals.

- As a government, we cooperate with others or defend ourselves and our interests.

- There's not much you can do about either of these.

- North Korean government, Zeus spyware, etc.  all of that will only alienate you.

- My job is the business level and we've got a lot to do there with our abstractions, but what can you do today?

# 5. The Privacy Game

- 
- [US State Privacy Legislation Tracker](https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/)
- [IGA | Senate Bill 5 - Consumer data protection](https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2023/bills/senate/5/details)
- [Global AI Law and Policy Tracker](https://iapp.org/resources/article/global-ai-legislation-tracker/)

- What are the goals of TikTok?
    - How does it get there?
    - What are the means to its end?
    - Show the engine
    - TikTok is awesome like casinos are or anything big and world changing

- What does social media sell?
    - The imperceptible change in human behavior
    - Don't boil the frog too fast
- I'm the crazy guy now…
    - Show the crazy IT person or conspiracy theory lover
    - …No I'm not

- What are your goals, or your financial dreams even for those primary goals
    - Are these things getting you there?

- What have you got to hide
    - You might say ssn or my face and all this - mostly cyber
    - Why does my likes matter? Or my preferences
    - Because huge data analytics companies can use that data on a very large scale and you can't be sure that it aligns with your goals/values. That's why privacy matters
- Show patchwork of privacy laws in the US and abroad
    - This is gonna take some work.
    - You can argue there needs to be boundaries here for the companies that can utilize large volumes of it and pass a profit margin threshold with it. Only a small number of companies that can turn the dial on this stuff
- That's the privacy stuff

# 6. The Cybersecurity Game

- By nature technology and systems are abstract and so it's not like highschool and college students can make a big dent.
- I'm one guy in a company of 400…how do we do it? It's hard by nature. We have to secure complex things that we don't understand and specialized teams of hackers try to thwart that, so we have to rely on security by design
- The proven parts of security are done with mostly math because you can prove it with a formula
- It all still relates to identity because that relates to interests and game theory
- So we get good at building walls and checking the people that walk through them

# 7. How to Play

- We can use it our way though and make a change
    - Just like casinos have card counters, we can hack the system in a way that's not unethical or immoral

# 4. The Different Levels of Responsibility

- Cyberwar - government
- IT infrastructure and system design - businesses
- Data usage - businesses
- Technology use and data exposure - families, individuals

- Government/nation state
- Business/entity level
- Families, individuals

- Why should you care?  It depends on your interests.

# 6. The Cybersecurity Issue

- .

# 7. 

OLDER IDEAS BELOW:

# 1. Hook, Icebreaker

- What do you think of nowadays when you hear that someone got hacked?
- How do you imagine a hacker?
- What have you got to hide?
- Do you care who has your data?
- So where do you put it and how do you get to it?
- How I picture IT people?
    - Show video with abstract and jargon terms
- Did I ask?

## How I/we got here

- Like most IT people, I played video games as a kid.  No joke.  
- The internet was exploding when I was a kid...it still kind of is
- (QUOTE) With every great change comes its curses.  The internet came with many.

## Why people don't listen to people like me sometimes

- FUD - fear, uncertainty, and doubt
- 

# 2. Introduction

## The news is a bit desensitizing

- Company got hacked
- Fraud
- Scam calls all the time
- I'm still standing…yeah yeah yeah
- So many stunt hacks
- Flipper Zero and TikTok hack culture...ugh

## Some of the news is actually bad though

- Hacked routers
- Cellphone companies infiltrated
- What is going on?

## Cyberworldwar 1

- ~2009 - Present
- Presidents start admitting it
- Some countries GDP is mostly hacking

## Privacy dilemmas and data eaters

- Privacy news
- Not just selling but usage of user data
- Europe has a GDPR but governance is slow and complex and slower than AI

## AI is exploding…good?..bad?

- .

## Quantum computing and cryptography

- Store now decrypt later

## It's just another day of ransomware and countries hacking each other

- .

## Where do y'all hear your news?

- MAYBE NOT

## It's about responsibility…who's responsible.

- It's being handled..it's fine
- The government? (Communism)
- By businesses?
- By individuals?

# 3.

## Cybersecurity

- What is cybersecurity?
- Cyber - to sail a sea of data
- Security - peace of mind
- I almost got killed by waves in Hawaii true story

## Our Mission at FORUM

- Helping members live their financial dreams

## What businesses do?

## What cybersecurity does?

# 4. Identity? (Whatever that means)

Where do you put it and how do you get to it? How do they get it and use it?

# 5. Cryptography and math

We don't trust intentions so we use math…no cap

# 6. What do I do?

- 

# 7. Resources and Tools

- 

## General Recommendations

- Have someone or yourself in your community/family/friend group who is the IT person.  Most families have an "IT dad" since it's a more popular career with men.  
- If they do A LOT of marketing, they likely have other intentions.  I'm looking at you VPNs
- 

## What About AI?

- It's not about the AI model, but rather where they store the data
- 

## Cybersecurity Recommendations

- Download and use Signal.  Text/SMS simply has gone too far in its use.  
- Use a password manager
	- Bitwarden
	- Proton Pass
	- 1Password
- Make better passwords.  You should only need to memorize the one for your password manager
- Use cyber deception in places with sensitive data that hackers would love to get their hands on.  
- Pay money to things you can trust and support and don't circumvent it.
	- Don't download things illegally.  These are almost always filled with viruses
- Delete your old accounts
- Anti-Virus
	- Bitdefender 
	- WebRoot 
	- Out-of-box AV for MacOS or Windows is good enough
- Don't use a VPN (most of the time)
	- Use Proton VPN or Mullvad if you do
	- Anything you would actually need a VPN for you can use a Tor browser or use something more comprehensive
	- I use Proton VPN when I get on guest Wi-Fi at hotels

## Privacy Recommendations

- Uninstall apps that waste your time.
- Turn off all notifications that are not urgent.
- Use a browser that doesn’t save your data, or remove extensions that give suggested recommendations.
	- Use Firefox or Brave
- Search engines
	- SearX
	- Brave Search
	- Startpage
	- Duckduckgo
	- Google (with all of the privacy settings turned up to 10)
- Don’t accept recommended videos on YouTube. (Instead, pick your own.)
- Fact check your sources before you share something on social media. (In particular, avoid content that strikes an emotional response.)
- You vote with your clicks. Only click things you actually care about.
- Read information from different points of view (including the ones you don’t’ agree with).
- Remove all devices from the bedroom every night. 
- Don’t allow your kid to get on social media until high school (better yet—until they are sixteen). 
- Budget how much time your kids spend in front of screens.
- Use random usernames and not the same one everywhere
- 

## What you don't need to do

This is what the paranoid people do and it gives good security hygiene a bad rap.

- Download TailsOS
- Replace your iOS/Android with Graphene
- Buy your house through a company to hide your identity
- Be a skeptical, arrogant, conspiracy theorist.

## Quotes

- The same technology that connects us can also control us.
- Innovations that empower us also have the potential to exploit us.
- Great technologies come with significant ethical dilemmas.
- The tools designed to enhance our lives can also undermine our autonomy.

- If you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product” — Daniel Hövermann
-  “There are only two industries that call their customers “users”: illegal drugs and software.” — Edward Tufte
- “Nothing vast enters the life of mortals without a curse.” — Sophocles
- “We curate our lives around this perceived sense of perfection because we get rewarded in these short term signals: hearts, likes, thumbs up and we conflate that with value and we conflate it with truth. And instead, what it is is fake brittle popularity that’s short term and that leaves you even more, and admit it, vacant and empty before you did it. Because that enforces you into a vicious cycle where you’re like what’s the next thing that I need to do now, because I need it back. Think about that compounded by two billion people and then think about how then people react to then to the perceptions of others.” — Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of Social Capital
-  “We’re training and conditioning a whole new generation of people that when we are uncomfortable or lonely or uncertain or afraid we have a digital pacifier for ourselves that is kind of atrophying our own ability to deal with that.” — Tristan Harris, former design ethicist at Google and co-founder of Centre for Humane Technologies
- “We’ve created a world in which online connection has become primary. Especially for younger generations. And yet, in that world, anytime two people connect, the only way it’s financed is through a sneaky third person who’s paying to manipulate those two people. So we’ve created an entire global generation of people who were raised within a context with the very meaning of communication, the very meaning of culture, is manipulation.” — Jaron Lainer, computer scientist and virtual reality pioneer
- “We’re the product. Our attention is the product being sold to advertisers.” - Justin Rosenstein, former engineer Facebook and Google, co-founder of Asana
- “It's the gradual, slight, imperceptible change in your own behaviour and perception that is the product.” - Jaron Lainer, founding father of Virtual Reality Computer Scientist
- “It's a marketplace that trades exclusively in human futures.” - Shoshana Zuboff, Harvard University professor
- “If something is a tool, it genuinely is just sitting there, waiting patiently. If something is not a tool it's demanding things from you. It's seducing you, it’s manipulating you, it wants things from you. We've moved away from a tools based technology environment, to an addiction and manipulation used technology environment. Social media isn't a tool waiting to be used. It has its own goals, and it has its own means of pursuing them by using your psychology against you.” - Tristan Harris, former design ethicist at Google and co-founder of Centre for Humane Technologies
- “I like to say that algorithms are opinions embedded in code. And that algorithms are not objective.    Algorithms are optimised to some definition of success. So if you can imagine, if a commercial enterprise builds an algorithm, to their definition of success, it’s a commercial interest. It’s usually profit.” - Cathy O’Neil, data scientist
- “The platforms make it possible to spread manipulative narratives with phenomenal ease, and without very much money.” - Renée Diresta, research manager of Stanford Internet Observatory, former head of policy at Data for Democracy
-  “When we were making the like button, our entire motivation was ‘can we spread positivity and love in the world?’ The idea that fast forward to today and teens would be getting depressed when they don’t have enough likes or it could be leading to political polarisation was nowhere on our radar.” - Justin Rosenstein, former engineer at Facebook and Google, co-founder of Asana
- “Never accept a video recommended to you on YouTube. Always choose. That’s another way to fight.” - Jaron Lainer, founding father of Virtual Reality Computer Scientist
- “Before you share, fact check. Consider the source. Do that extra Google. If it seems like it’s designed to push your emotional buttons, it probably is.” - Renée Diresta, research manager of Stanford Internet Observatory, former head of policy at Data for Democracy
- “I've uninstalled a ton of apps from my phone that I felt were wasting my time. All the social media apps, all the news apps and I've turned off notifications on anything that was vibrating my leg with information that wasn’t timely and important to me right now. It’s for the same reason that I don’t keep cookies in my pocket.” - Justin Rosenstein, former engineer at Facebook and Google, co-fonder of Asana
