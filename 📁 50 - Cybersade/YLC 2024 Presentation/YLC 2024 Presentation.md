- Icebreak
    - Who's highschool
    - Who's college
- I'm going to set a goal here
    - For every presentation slide, I need someone to comment or ask a question
- My background
    - Diver and cheerleader in highschool
    - Played video games here and there.
    - My dad is the tech dad and in cybersecurity, so I talked about it all the time
- How do you picture IT people?
    - IT arrogance word cloud
    - We all have our hobbies…emphasis on hobbies
    - Askers anyone?
    - Takers?
    - Reaction meme
- IT meme “why don't you use ____”

    - I'm not here to do that
    - But here to tell you why you should care and why it will help you with your individual goals, family goals, and business goals
- Cyber origin
    - Kaiber
    - To sail
    - Explore cyberspace and information
    - But don't let the waves just take you
- I was in Hawaii and almost got killed by a wave because I ignored the lifeguard…true story
- I also became a lifeguard the next summer
- So why care….why?
- Who's got nothing to hide?
    - Be honest
    - What is someone going to use from you?
- I've got one
    - How about your future
- What does social media sell?
    - The imperceptible change in human behavior
    - Don't boil the frog too fast
- I'm the crazy guy now…
    - Show the crazy IT person or conspiracy theory lover
    - …No I'm not
- Who here has goals?
    - Oh crap…that's a deep question.
    - If you have goals, then you have to care and here's why
- The philosophy of cybersecurity and privacy
    - Show the definitions
- What are the goals of TikTok?
    - How does it get there?
    - What are the means to its end?
    - Show the engine
    - TikTok is awesome like casinos are or anything big and world changing
- We can use it our way though and make a change
    - Just like casinos have card counters, we can hack the system in a way that's not unethical or immoral
- What are your goals, or your financial dreams even for those primary goals

    - Are these things getting you there?
- What have you got to hide
    - You might say ssn or my face and all this - mostly cyber
    - Why does my likes matter? Or my preferences
    - Because huge data analytics companies can use that data on a very large scale and you can't be sure that it aligns with your goals/values. That's why privacy matters
- Show patchwork of privacy laws in the US and abroad
    - This is gonna take some work.
    - You can argue there needs to be boundaries here for the companies that can utilize large volumes of it and pass a profit margin threshold with it. Only a small number of companies that can turn the dial on this stuff
- That's the privacy stuff

- Cybersecurity stuff
    - It's about exploiting technology and systems
- By nature technology and systems are abstract and so it's not like highschool and college students can make a big dent.

- However, you want to be protected and make a difference still so here's how
- I'm one guy in a company of 400…how do we do it? It's hard by nature. We have to secure complex things that we don't understand and specialized teams of hackers try to thwart that, so we have to rely on security by design
- The proven parts of security are done with mostly math because you can prove it with a formula
- It all still relates to identity because that relates to interests and game theory
- So we get good at building walls and checking the people that walk through them

## Presentation Tech

- Mentimeter but somehow without pauses?
- Maybe just for after or during discussion?

## Quotes

- With great power comes great responsibility - Spiderman
- The same technology that connects us can also control us.
- Innovations that empower us also have the potential to exploit us.
- Great technologies come with significant ethical dilemmas.
- The tools designed to enhance our lives can also undermine our autonomy.

- If you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product” — Daniel Hövermann
-  “There are only two industries that call their customers “users”: illegal drugs and software.” — Edward Tufte
- “Nothing vast enters the life of mortals without a curse.” — Sophocles
- “We curate our lives around this perceived sense of perfection because we get rewarded in these short term signals: hearts, likes, thumbs up and we conflate that with value and we conflate it with truth. And instead, what it is is fake brittle popularity that’s short term and that leaves you even more, and admit it, vacant and empty before you did it. Because that enforces you into a vicious cycle where you’re like what’s the next thing that I need to do now, because I need it back. Think about that compounded by two billion people and then think about how then people react to then to the perceptions of others.” — Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of Social Capital
-  “We’re training and conditioning a whole new generation of people that when we are uncomfortable or lonely or uncertain or afraid we have a digital pacifier for ourselves that is kind of atrophying our own ability to deal with that.” — Tristan Harris, former design ethicist at Google and co-founder of Centre for Humane Technologies
- “We’ve created a world in which online connection has become primary. Especially for younger generations. And yet, in that world, anytime two people connect, the only way it’s financed is through a sneaky third person who’s paying to manipulate those two people. So we’ve created an entire global generation of people who were raised within a context with the very meaning of communication, the very meaning of culture, is manipulation.” — Jaron Lainer, computer scientist and virtual reality pioneer
- “We’re the product. Our attention is the product being sold to advertisers.” - Justin Rosenstein, former engineer Facebook and Google, co-founder of Asana
- “It's the gradual, slight, imperceptible change in your own behaviour and perception that is the product.” - Jaron Lainer, founding father of Virtual Reality Computer Scientist
- “It's a marketplace that trades exclusively in human futures.” - Shoshana Zuboff, Harvard University professor
- “If something is a tool, it genuinely is just sitting there, waiting patiently. If something is not a tool it's demanding things from you. It's seducing you, it’s manipulating you, it wants things from you. We've moved away from a tools based technology environment, to an addiction and manipulation used technology environment. Social media isn't a tool waiting to be used. It has its own goals, and it has its own means of pursuing them by using your psychology against you.” - Tristan Harris, former design ethicist at Google and co-founder of Centre for Humane Technologies
- “I like to say that algorithms are opinions embedded in code. And that algorithms are not objective.    Algorithms are optimised to some definition of success. So if you can imagine, if a commercial enterprise builds an algorithm, to their definition of success, it’s a commercial interest. It’s usually profit.” - Cathy O’Neil, data scientist
- “The platforms make it possible to spread manipulative narratives with phenomenal ease, and without very much money.” - Renée Diresta, research manager of Stanford Internet Observatory, former head of policy at Data for Democracy
-  “When we were making the like button, our entire motivation was ‘can we spread positivity and love in the world?’ The idea that fast forward to today and teens would be getting depressed when they don’t have enough likes or it could be leading to political polarisation was nowhere on our radar.” - Justin Rosenstein, former engineer at Facebook and Google, co-founder of Asana
- “Never accept a video recommended to you on YouTube. Always choose. That’s another way to fight.” - Jaron Lainer, founding father of Virtual Reality Computer Scientist
- “Before you share, fact check. Consider the source. Do that extra Google. If it seems like it’s designed to push your emotional buttons, it probably is.” - Renée Diresta, research manager of Stanford Internet Observatory, former head of policy at Data for Democracy
- “I've uninstalled a ton of apps from my phone that I felt were wasting my time. All the social media apps, all the news apps and I've turned off notifications on anything that was vibrating my leg with information that wasn’t timely and important to me right now. It’s for the same reason that I don’t keep cookies in my pocket.” - Justin Rosenstein, former engineer at Facebook and Google, co-fonder of Asana
