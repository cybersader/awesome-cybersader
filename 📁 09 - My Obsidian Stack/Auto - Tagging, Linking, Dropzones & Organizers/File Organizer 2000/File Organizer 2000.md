- If you want to use OpenAI Gpt
	- Make an account and go to
	- https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
	- Paste the API key back in Obsidian
- If you want to use Ollama
	- https://ollama.com/
	- ![500](_attachments/File%20Organizer%202000/IMG-20240818160940082.png)
	- You can find the models you can use @ https://ollama.com/library
	- File Organizer uses the internal REST API found @ https://github.com/ollama/ollama?tab=readme-ov-file#rest-api
	- To use it, we just have to use the known port with localhost for the "Ollama Model" under the "Advanced Config" settings for "AI File Organizer 2000" in Obsidian

	- If we host on our computer, we ned to use "OLLAMA_ORIGINS=* ollama serve" for environment variables
		- [How can I allow additional web origins to access Ollama?](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-can-i-allow-additional-web-origins-to-access-ollama)
		- [How do I configure Ollama server?](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server)
	- To set up environment variables in Windows
		- ![400](_attachments/File%20Organizer%202000/IMG-20240818160940222.png)
	- To run a model
		- "ollama run <model_name>"
		- ![400](_attachments/File%20Organizer%202000/IMG-20240818160940346.png)
		- It will take awhile to download and verify the files
	- It should work in Obsidian once it's running
	- Make sure you matched the model you're running and the settings in Obsidian
		- ![400](_attachments/File%20Organizer%202000/IMG-20240818160940405.png)
	- Anytime you want to use a different model, you need to download it with ollama run
