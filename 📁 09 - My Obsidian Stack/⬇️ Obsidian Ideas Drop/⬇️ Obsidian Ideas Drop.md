- [ ] Fix issue with using Obsidian Publish between two devices and having to republish the whole vault everytime 🔺 ➕ 2024-11-03
- [ ] Linter that can be given conditions, bulk handling, or ability to ask user about certain cases before linting the file? ➕ 2024-11-06
- [ ] Vault crawler tool that uses AI to find connections in the vault - kind of like Omnisearch + File Organizer 2000 ➕ 2024-11-07

# Ideas

- Make extension for usage in Github.dev for helping do markdown without code in innovative and safe ways
  - If this doesn't work then look at how other in-the-browser code editors are safe and if they could somehow be implemented
- Obsidian GitHub action for running code like a vault would
- StackEdit with GitHub as alternative to Github.dev?
- Linting for filenames and folders to make sure that they work on Windows (No ":" and other characters)
- [ ] Plugin or pull request to current plugin to clean youtube and amazon links of cookie and reference code stuff ➕ 2024-11-03 
- [ ] Add saving current workspace layout to custom save ⏫ ➕ 2024-11-03
- [ ] Smarter changelog plugin ⏫ ➕ 2024-11-04
