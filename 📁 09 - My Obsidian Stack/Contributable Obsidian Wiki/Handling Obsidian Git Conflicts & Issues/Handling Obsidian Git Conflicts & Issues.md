- Conflicts often happen with the workspace.json file
	- You can see how to fix it @ [Obsidian Setup for Corporate](../../Obsidian%20Setup%20for%20Corporate/Obsidian%20Setup%20for%20Corporate.md)
	- Here's the issue:

		- You go onto a different device and go to sync with the "remote" repo or the one actually in GitHub
		- The problem is that `workspace.json` changes fast even as the merge is happening
- Conflicts that occur after fixing the issue with [Gitignore Folder Tracking Removal](üìÅ%2021%20-%20Development/Git/Gitignore%20Folder%20Tracking%20Removal/Gitignore%20Folder%20Tracking%20Removal.md#3%20Untrack%20All%20Files%20Listed%20in%20gitignore)
