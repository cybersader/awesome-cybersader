# Syncing & Collaboration

- This is the hardest part of solving the using Obsidian in corporate problem.  Plugins can at least be controlled and whitelisted.  The goal with using Obsidian is to cheat the system by having a really cheap, valuable, extensible, universal system, all with plaintext on the backend for compatibility and flexibility.
- You may be thinking, why not just use git with "[Obsidian Git](../Obsidian%20Git/Obsidian%20Git.md)"?  Yes...that will work most of the time, unless you have plugins that add data right when you open pages or the vault.  Constantly having conflicts and git errors is a chore.

- Whitelist certain URLs from the Obsidian plugin repo so that the vault can install the plugin data from that particular whitelisted repo path
- Do this for each whitelisted and approved plugin
- Have a process for this approval through help desk and/or InfoSec teams
