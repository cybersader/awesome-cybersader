# Syncing & Collaboration

[Collaboration in Obsidian](../Contributable%20Obsidian%20Wiki/Collaboration%20in%20Obsidian/Collaboration%20in%20Obsidian.md)
[Syncing Obsidian](../Syncing%20Obsidian/Syncing%20Obsidian.md)

- This is the hardest part of solving the using Obsidian in corporate problem.  Plugins can at least be controlled and whitelisted.  The goal with using Obsidian is to cheat the system by having a really cheap, valuable, extensible, universal system, all with plaintext on the backend for compatibility and flexibility.
- You may be thinking, why not just use git with "[Obsidian Git](../Obsidian%20Git/Obsidian%20Git.md)"?  Yes...that will work most of the time, unless you have plugins that add data right when you open pages or the vault.  Constantly having conflicts and git errors is a chore.

	- [You can also have separate folders synced across devices by using GIT sparse-checkout approach. On each device you can set what folders it will sync with main repository. Thus, you can keep work related notes updated in your main vault and on your work compputer without sharing personal notes on your work machine. Same approach can be used on smartphones, if you can get GIT working on that device. I sync my phone in my selfhosted cloud solution with Obsidian app.](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/yet-another-obsidian-git-tutorial-desktop-pc-ipad-sync/67531)

	- Workspaces Plus
- Files to not sync
	- Generally, don't sync the workspace and other `.obsidian` folders or files.  You'll get conflicts usually as you try sync at the same time while Obsidian updates those files as they change

### Obsidian Git Options

- Merge strategy
- Auto Commit
- Disable on this device
- Shouldn't there be a setting to ask if you want to commit/push?

### Solutions to Git Conflict Issues

#### 1) Add some folders and files to gitignore

Add a `.gitignore` file with the following lines:

```
.obsidian/workspace-mobile.json
.obsidian/workspace.json
.obsidian/workspace
.obsidian/plugins/home-tab/data.json
# Maybe the below one too
*data.json
```

# IAM and User Management?

- obsidian sharing collaboration user control active directory

# Version Control

- Obsidian Git

# Obsidian Plugin Security

- [Obsidian Vault Security](../Obsidian%20Vault%20Security/Obsidian%20Vault%20Security.md)
- Firewall should already have a whitelist approach and general network security controls
- Endpoints should have application whitelisting implemented
- Whitelist the Obsidian application to run

- Whitelist certain URLs from the Obsidian plugin repo so that the vault can install the plugin data from that particular whitelisted repo path
- Do this for each whitelisted and approved plugin
- Have a process for this approval through help desk and/or InfoSec teams
