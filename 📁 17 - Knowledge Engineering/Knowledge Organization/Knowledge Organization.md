# Wiki Organization Methodologies, Taxonomies, Structures

## Organizing Using the Library of Congress Subject Headings

- https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=congress
- https://github.com/kometenstaub/linked-data-vocabularies
	- Used library of congress taxonomy/folksonomy
- Had to download the MADS/RDF JSONLD file from - https://id.loc.gov/download/
- Set the path in the linked-data-vocabularies tool
- Then, query it by doing 'Ctrl + P' > LCSH > type in category
- Apparently, the Breadcrumbs plugin can help facilitate use of this plugin as well
- Not generating JSON files:
	- ["Linked data helper" plugin by kometenstaub - Bug graveyard - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/linked-data-helper-plugin-by-kometenstaub/28875) - probably hasn't been working for awhile now

- **==id.loc.gov API - related to "Linked Data" and Subject Headings==**
	- Description:
		- Each controlled vocabulary list has a resolvable URI, as does each data value within it. Ontologies for several major data element sets are also available. URIs accessible at id.loc.gov link to bibliographic descriptions and controlled vocabularies and the values within them. This data service does not provide access to the physical or electronic holdings of the Library.

- Related, but not the desired API - LoC.gov API
	- [JSON/YAML for LoC.gov | APIs for LoC.gov | Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/apis/json-and-yaml/) - not for the "linked data" and (subsequently) the subject headings data though
