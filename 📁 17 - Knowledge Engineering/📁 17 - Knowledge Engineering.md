> [!tldr] The term that encompasses the science of knowledge, information retrieval, and ontology traversal is **"Knowledge Engineering"**. This interdisciplinary field involves the development of systems that can understand, model, and manage knowledge, facilitating information retrieval and effective navigation through complex ontologies. Knowledge engineering combines principles from computer science, artificial intelligence, information science, and cognitive science to create frameworks and tools for capturing, organizing, and utilizing knowledge in various domains for the purpose of knowledge work.

Knowledge Procurement (learning and information retrieval) is a difficult topic that is at the core of how we learn, communicate, gather knowledge. It includes things like epistemology, curation steps, representing knowledge in various formats in engineered workflows.

Put simply though, just ways get knowledge:

- Specific Knowledge Curation & Ontology Representation Websites or Areas of Knowledge and Problem Domain Curation
    - Problem Domain (ontology) exploration
