# Initial Mapping for Frameworks

https://www.nist.gov/quick-start-guides

- Initial Mapping - CSF 2.0
	- CSF Core - https://csrc.nist.gov/extensions/nudp/services/json/csf/download?olirids=all 
		- A taxonomy of high-level cybersecurity outcomes that can help any organization manage its cybersecurity risks.

- Mapping to other frameworks, informative references
	- Informative References 
		- https://www.nist.gov/informative-references
		- [National Online Informative References Program | CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/olir/informative-reference-catalog#/)
		- help inform how an organization may achieve the Coreâ€™s outcomes. Given the diversity of use cases this page allows the user to choose how to best consume Informative References.
