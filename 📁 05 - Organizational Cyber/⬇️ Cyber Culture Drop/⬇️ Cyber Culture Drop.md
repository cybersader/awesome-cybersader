## Cyber Awareness Month (October)

- Cyber Awareness Month is held in October because it was officially designated as "Cybersecurity Awareness Month" by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security back in 2004, making October the dedicated month to raise awareness about cybersecurity issues across the country and globally; this initiative is a collaborative effort between government and industry to educate the public about online safety practices.
