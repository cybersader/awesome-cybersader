Data Privacy - why you *actually* have something to hide

This is the most common argument you hear when people start talking about data privacy and it's usually the reaction to some comments about Chinese espionage, talks about VPNs, or the result of what FUD media is pushing lately about technology.  We are going to cut through all of that this week so you can know what to actually worry about and how to think about data privacy in a simple way.

So, What *Is* Data Privacy?

Data privacy is about your ability to control _who_ has information about you and _how_ they use it. It’s not just about hiding embarrassing photos or paranoid government conspiracies. It’s about power dynamics—who holds the data, how that data gets used, and whether it aligns with _your_ interests.

Why Should *You* Care?

- **Data can be used to hurt your goals.**  
    Even if you live a squeaky-clean life, having every search query, purchase, or click tracked and compiled could eventually be leveraged in ways you never intended. Think personalized persuasion that pushes you away from your true goals.
    
- **Data can be used to hurt our members.**  
    In our line of work, trust is everything. If malicious actors gain insights into our members’ activities, it can damage their interests and our reputation in one swoop.
    
- **Data can be used to hurt our mission.**  
    Whether it’s shaping narratives, selling off insights, or simply weaponizing information to stall our projects—having the wrong people in control of our data can sabotage our overarching goals as an organization.

Notice that it's about control over who has your data and how they can use it.

So whats the problem with someone having our data and who are the "someones" that are risky.

We are bad at seeing long-term dangers

One of the biggest challenges with data privacy is that the _harm_ often appears in small ways, over a long period of time. We humans are wired to notice immediate threats—like an email scam in your inbox—but the real danger can creep in silently over months or years. History is full of examples where personal data or records got collected for one benign purpose and ended up being used for something far worse down the line.

The Real Problem

1. **Data is power.**  
    Our computers and the internet started out as tools for solving math problems and sending emails. Now they shape shopping habits, political opinions, and even personal relationships.
    
2. **We can’t foresee all the ways data might be used.**  
    Technology evolves rapidly. Today’s harmless info can become tomorrow’s goldmine for manipulation—by corporations, adversaries, or rogue third parties.
    
3. **Transparency matters.**  
    Hiding data practices or collecting info without consent leads to deceptive power imbalances. If you don’t know _who_ is doing _what_ with your data, how can you protect yourself or our members?

Bottom Line

- **Privacy is about choice**: If you don’t control who has your data, _they_ control your narrative (and possibly your future).
- **Small leaks accumulate**: Each seemingly inconsequential tidbit can be pieced together into a revealing (and exploitable) big picture.
- **Your values matter**: Data can be sold, shared, or analyzed in ways that directly oppose your personal or organizational values—even if you never see it happening.

When you hear “I’ve got nothing to hide,” remember it’s not about hiding shady activities. It’s about preventing power imbalances and ensuring our data isn’t used against us—or those we serve—in ways we can’t predict.

So yes, you _do_ have something to hide. And that “something” is your ability to shape your own story, your own decisions, and your own future—without unwanted interference.

_Stay informed, stay empowered, and let’s keep our data where it belongs: under our control._

Why the "I've got nothing to hide" argument doesn't fly anymore.
Why Data Privacy matters.

- What is Data Privacy?
	- Data privacy generally means the ability of a person to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent personal information about them is shared with or communicated to others.
	- Privacy assumes that knowledge about you can be used to "hurt" you or your goals

- Is someone right just because they are persuasive?

- Can data about you be used to hurt your goals?
- Can data be used to hurt our members' goals?
- Can data be used to hurt our mission to our members?

- The answer is all yes.

- Nowadays,
	- Data is power
	- We made computers at first to solve hard math problems, but computers and the communication of them (the internet) have evolved to encompass every aspect of our lives
	- As they become an integral part of our lives, they eat up tons of data about people
- Data privacy is important, because the data about us (namely our interests) can be used to harm those interests
	- It's not about a country or the NSA spying on you or looking at what you're buying on Amazon.  It's about the less obvious things that happen over long periods of time.

- The ways of upholding data privacy personally, as a business, and for our members affect way more than just the case of persuasive technologies and big data analytics.  However, the main goal of data privacy is to prevent a system where those with data processing power can control those without it.  It's about transparency and being less deceptive.

- If your data can be used to further the interests of those who's interests conflict with your own, then you should care.  It is true that someone who has enough data about you can use it in a way that doesn't align with your values.  Therefore, data privacy matters to everyone.

- Let me phrase it another way...
	- Having control over who gets data about you matters, because it can be used in ways that hurt your goals.  The problem with data privacy is that it's hard to quantify the damage as it happens in little ways over time.
- We can't anticipate what others can do with data about us.  They might not even directly use it to exploit you.  They may use it to hurt other people or for their business which goes against your values.  We all won't agree on what's right or what's wrong.  No matter what, whoever your "enemy" is, they can wield data about you in ways that hurt your goals.  

- One issue that prevents privacy from becoming a priority is that the effects are harder to see in the short term especially as you scale it out to a nation rather than just a person.  

- we are wired for the short term and immediacy.  People are to a point better at defending against things like scams and sharing super sensitive data because the damage is done in a very noticeable short-term way.  We are pretty aware when we are being exploited in the short term or in danger with some immediate threat.  But data privacy isn't like the bear in the woods.  It's more like a creeping fog of poisonous gas.  Overtime as we put our data into more and more services and apps, this data is built up to make a detailed profile about each and every one of us.  That in and of itself is not a danger but rather it can be used in ways that are dangerous.  That's a more personal level you could see data about you being used to take up your time by being on your screen more with advertisements, maybe cluttering your email or text messages with spam, and then we get to the issues that are larger scale.  For instance maybe a business has enough data to market to certain individuals and become successful.  However that business used your data along with thousands of other people to further their business schools.  The issue being that those goals might very well be against your own or even malicious in the grand scheme of things.  And then we get up to the nation state risks like countries doing espionage and things like that.  At that level we're looking at some risks that I wouldn't prioritize but are still a problem.  I'm sure many countries are using this data to think about how they can change our interests right or the things that we care about.  The nation state goal here is espionage and eroding interests of other countries slowly.  
- at the level that we care more about the problem is that we have trouble weighing convenience against the potential harms especially when it's with technology because it's so abstract
- generally with these complex industries that have a lot of deep knowledge about that particular niche and come with high risks for most people, usually the government does something about it or they put systems in place for us to make those risk assessments and decisions ourselves 
- in the case of data privacy some countries have already done that however there is definitely a lot of pushback the past few years in the United States 
- All this definitely becomes more prevalent with AI too because AI is really good at maximizing some goal.  In the case of marketing or advertisements that's getting people to buy things, and we don't know what the side effects are of the AI trying to reach those goals on a large scale.  But also maybe it's to change people's interests or goals or preferences.  No matter what the goal is of using AI, issue now becomes that some business or entity has way more power than most people and they gain that power when they get more data about people.  For AI more data is more power and that's the risk for everyone and businesses
