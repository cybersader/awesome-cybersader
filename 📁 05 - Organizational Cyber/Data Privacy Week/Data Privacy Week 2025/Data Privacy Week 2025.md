### Day 1) Intranet Post

Why the "I've got nothing to hide" argument doesn't fly anymore.
Why Data Privacy matters.

- What is Data Privacy?
	- Data privacy generally means the ability of a person to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent personal information about them is shared with or communicated to others.
	- Privacy assumes that knowledge about you can be used to "hurt" you or your goals

- Is someone right just because they are persuasive?

- Can data about you be used to hurt your goals?
- Can data be used to hurt our members' goals?
- Can data be used to hurt our mission to our members?

- The answer is all yes.

- Nowadays,
	- Data is power
	- We made computers at first to solve hard math problems, but computers and the communication of them (the internet) have evolved to encompass every aspect of our lives
	- As they become an integral part of our lives, they eat up tons of data about people
- Data privacy is important, because the data about us (namely our interests) can be used to harm those interests
	- It's not about a country or the NSA spying on you or looking at what you're buying on Amazon.  It's about the less obvious things that happen over long periods of time.

- The ways of upholding data privacy personally, as a business, and for our members affect way more than just the case of persuasive technologies and big data analytics.  However, the main goal of data privacy is to prevent a system where those with data processing power can control those without it.  It's about transparency and being less deceptive.

- If your data can be used to further the interests of those who's interests conflict with your own, then you should care.  It is true that someone who has enough data about you can use it in a way that doesn't align with your values.  Therefore, data privacy matters to everyone.

- Let me phrase it another way...
	- Having control over who gets data about you matters, because it can be used in ways that hurt your goals.  The problem with data privacy is that it's hard to quantify the damage as it happens in little ways over time.
- We can't anticipate what others can do with data about us.  They might not even directly use it to exploit you.  They may use it to hurt other people or for their business which goes against your values.  We all won't agree on what's right or what's wrong.  No matter what, whoever your "enemy" is, they can wield data about you in ways that hurt your goals.

However, the main goal of data privacy is to prevent a system where those with data processing power can control those without it.  It's about transparency and being less deceptive.

- If your data can be used to further the interests of those who's interests conflict with your own, then you should care.  It is true that someone who has enough data about you can use it in a way that doesn't align with your values.  Therefore, data privacy matters to everyone.

- We can't anticipate what others can do with data about us.  They might not even directly use it to exploit you.  They may use it to hurt other people or for their business which goes against your values.  We all won't agree on what's right or what's wrong.  No matter what, whoever your "enemy" is, they can wield data about you in ways that hurt your goals.  

- One issue that prevents privacy from becoming a priority is that the effects are harder to see in the short term especially as you scale it out to a nation rather than just a person.  

- we are wired for the short term and immediacy.  People are to a point better at defending against things like scams and sharing super sensitive data because the damage is done in a very noticeable short-term way.  We are pretty aware when we are being exploited in the short term or in danger with some immediate threat.  But data privacy isn't like the bear in the woods.  It's more like a creeping fog of poisonous gas.  Overtime as we put our data into more and more services and apps, this data is built up to make a detailed profile about each and every one of us.  That in and of itself is not a danger but rather it can be used in ways that are dangerous.  That's a more personal level you could see data about you being used to take up your time by being on your screen more with advertisements, maybe cluttering your email or text messages with spam, and then we get to the issues that are larger scale.  For instance maybe a business has enough data to market to certain individuals and become successful.  However that business used your data along with thousands of other people to further their business schools.  The issue being that those goals might very well be against your own or even malicious in the grand scheme of things.  And then we get up to the nation state risks like countries doing espionage and things like that.  At that level we're looking at some risks that I wouldn't prioritize but are still a problem.  I'm sure many countries are using this data to think about how they can change our interests right or the things that we care about.  The nation state goal here is espionage and eroding interests of other countries slowly.  
- at the level that we care more about the problem is that we have trouble weighing convenience against the potential harms especially when it's with technology because it's so abstract
- generally with these complex industries that have a lot of deep knowledge about that particular niche and come with high risks for most people, usually the government does something about it or they put systems in place for us to make those risk assessments and decisions ourselves 
- in the case of data privacy some countries have already done that however there is definitely a lot of pushback the past few years in the United States 
- All this definitely becomes more prevalent with AI too because AI is really good at maximizing some goal.  In the case of marketing or advertisements that's getting people to buy things, and we don't know what the side effects are of the AI trying to reach those goals on a large scale.  But also maybe it's to change people's interests or goals or preferences.  No matter what the goal is of using AI, issue now becomes that some business or entity has way more power than most people and they gain that power when they get more data about people.  For AI more data is more power and that's the risk for everyone and businesses
