## Data Privacy Week

### Day 1) Intranet Post

Why the "I've got nothing to hide" argument doesn't fly anymore.
Why Data Privacy matters.

- What is Data Privacy?
	- Data privacy generally means the ability of a person to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent personal information about them is shared with or communicated to others.
	- Privacy assumes that knowledge about you can be used to "hurt" you or your goals

- Is someone right just because they are persuasive?

- Can data about you be used to hurt your goals?
- Can data be used to hurt our members' goals?
- Can data be used to hurt our mission to our members?

- The answer is all yes.

- Nowadays,
	- Data is power
	- We made computers at first to solve hard math problems, but computers and the communication of them (the internet) have evolved to encompass every aspect of our lives
	- As they become an integral part of our lives, they eat up tons of data about people
- Data privacy is important, because the data about us (namely our interests) can be used to harm those interests
	- It's not about a country or the NSA spying on you or looking at what you're buying on Amazon.  It's about the less obvious things that happen over long periods of time.

- The ways of upholding data privacy personally, as a business, and for our members affect way more than just the case of persuasive technologies and big data analytics.  However, the main goal of data privacy is to prevent a system where those with data processing power can control those without it.  It's about transparency and being less deceptive.

- If your data can be used to further the interests of those who's interests conflict with your own, then you should care.  It is true that someone who has enough data about you can use it in a way that doesn't align with your values.  Therefore, data privacy matters to everyone.

- Let me phrase it another way...
	- Having control over who gets data about you matters, because it can be used in ways that hurt your goals.  The problem with data privacy is that it's hard to quantify the damage as it happens in little ways over time.
- We can't anticipate what others can do with data about us.  They might not even directly use it to exploit you.  They may use it to hurt other people or for their business which goes against your values.  We all won't agree on what's right or what's wrong.  No matter what, whoever your "enemy" is, they can wield data about you in ways that hurt your goals.
