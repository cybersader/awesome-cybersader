# Presentation / Keynote (15 min)

- Define Data Privacy and the role it plays in today’s digital word
	- 
- Why it matters and how it impacts individuals, organizations, society
	- 
- Know what information you are sharing and how it is collected/obtained
	- 
- How to understand privacy policies/laws
	- In the US, they are completely fragmented and complicated.  Most nation-wide companies just meet the standards for the hardest one so that they comply across the board.
- Why it matters. Discuss growing risk (breaches, misuse)
	- What you do to protect members affects privacy and security

# Pre-Submitted Q&A (20 min)

## Cookies

- What is really happening when I click "Accept Cookies" when I visit a website?
	- 
- How can I make the best decisions when to accept cookies or deny?
	- Think of it like a donation.  If you don't trust them or support them enough to donate 5 bucks, then don't accept the cookies.
	- Do you ACTUALLY trust what the company does with data about you?
- Are there red flags to look for in terms of transparency or trustworthiness when it comes to privacy policies
	- Look for third party, targeting, and marketing in the policy.  This will often bring up the things that matter.  Companies are typically quite vague in this part.

## Best Practices

- What are ways at work that I can ensure our data remains protected
	- Check out the data hygiene guide
	- Clean up your network drives and department drives of old data
	- Keep the phishing emails in mind
	- Never ever reuse passwords especially between personal and work - super risky
	- If you get an MFA/authenticator push notification on your phone even though you didn't try logging in, then call IT
	- Don't put our data onto unapproved websites or ones that aren't part of the defined responsibilities.  
- What are some warning signs that my personal data privacy has been compromised?
	- This is true for almost everyone already because we live in the United States.  The constitution could not have accounted for modern data privacy.
- What is a free password/passcode generator or 2FA that I can use personally?
	- Talk about authentication factors.
	- Use Bitwarden and any one of the authenticator apps.  These are attached to your physical phone.
- What steps can one take to protect their personal data privacy?
	- Some easy wins are to:
		- Use a privacy respecting browser - Firefox and Brave are good
		- Don't use a VPN (usually) - if you do, then actually research legitimately private VPNs
		- Use plus addressing with your gmail or use an email aliasing service
		- Be careful of where you put your phone number
		- Look for privacy settings in the main apps that you use day-to-day

- (While not specific to DeepSink – what are general guidelines or professional wisdom we should understand before we sign up for any new service or app?)
	- Think about it from the interests perspective.  Assume that the company you are signing up with is an evil company.  What could they do with the data going into the app?  Your data could be used to support a group of bad guys.  
	- With AI, the AI may have been trained on content biased towards that group.  In other words, even if you somehow downloaded the AI to run in a bunker under your house without internet access, it may give you biased answers with baked in interests of the ones who made it.

## Data Privacy

- What risks do social media platforms like TikTok pose to my privacy?
	- Every risk you can think of.
	- No matter where you lean politically, social media platforms have immense data about peoples' interests.  You are in fact your choices, and companies like TikTok have a pretty good idea of the things you choose or they wouldn't be able to sell to advertisers so effectively.
	- Data privacy is about having control over who users your data and how.  In the case of TikTok, you have absolutely no control over the data because that data goes into a country where there are zero protections on how that data is used and for whose interests.  
	- Most social media platforms use this data for advertisers and share it (not "sell" it) with other large marketing organizations or social media companies.  
	- Social media makes money by selling your future - plain and simple - whether that future is buying a product, being more interested in something that could make someone money in the future, or giving you a new hobby.  We can argue about why you should care about that, but you have next to no control over where this data goes.  It is the epitome of not being able to control how information about you is used.  Some of these platforms have opt-in settings that are not turned on by default that you can set up.  This is a good first step for these companies.  However, companies like TikTok do not have these options and it's up for grabs once it's in a country with less privacy protections.  
	- The question you have to ask yourself ultimately is if your use of technology is getting your closer to your ultimate goal or not.  With companies that don't give you control over your data, your use of technology usually furthers their profit goals but not your own personal goals.
- How secure are financial and healthcare records?
	- This is less of a data privacy issue where the problem would be about users control over their data and more about data security.  Financial and healthcare record security from those who shouldn't have access to it is totally dependent on the company handling it.  There are several areas in a business that overlap between data security and data privacy.  For instance, with data retention and destruction standards in a company, the company is supposed to delete the data that they don't need after a certain period.  However, some organizations are bad at this and keep the data indefinitely.  When a breach happens (not if) this company could be exposing 100 million health records instead of 1 million because of bad data hygiene.  
	- If the financial or healthcare-related company has good data privacy practices, then this lessens the impact of a breach that could occur.  
	- We have several regulations for such data that require certain defenses to keep this type of data protected such as HIPPA, PCI, and more.
- How does AI intersect with data privacy?
	- AI requires lots of data, has its own interests, and has a lot of utility dependent on the amount of data they train on
	- Lots of companies want to use AI to improve their services and beat the competition, but this "velocity" and innovation brings with it lots of data privacy risks.  Most of these companies do not put defenses in place to guarantee that users have control over how their data is used with these new tools.
- What are the most common data privacy risks that people should be aware of?
	- I think the largest data privacy risk is the inability to see and use the things that you really want or need to on the internet.  
		- In other words, time and resource wasting.
		- Think of it like going to walk through a city street and find stores you want to go through, but instead of seeing stores you have a group of 80 people following you around will boards advertising which store you should go to and you can't see past them.  Originally, you walked out to find a certain place.  Instead of it taking you 15 minutes to go find that place, it takes you 4 hours because it's hard to see anywhere past the people following you and you had gotten distracted and needed to stop and get some food.  Not only did you waste time, but you had to spend money to eat out.  
		- We all are problem solvers that use the internet in some way to fulfill whatever mission we have, and organizations including Google itself use data.  We aren't all mindless robots running around buying whatever the ads tell us to buy, but I'm sure we've all noticed how bad Google searches have gotten over the years, how distracting technology has become, or how it feels like it wants something from you whether that's for you to buy or see something.
		- The internet and information retrieval systems like Google Search were made to help us find solutions to our problems.  But now it can feel like they're saying, here's our solution and here's the problem you didn't know you had.  Or you only see information from the highest bidder.
	- At the personal level, the other would be misinformation from social media or search engines, echo chambers, and the psychological damages that can come as an effect of these user data-wielding systems.
	- In general, the data privacy risks at every level are that you are being exploited for someone else's motives.  
	- Having control over your data makes it easier to use the internet, easier to have good relationships, easier to find the things you need, possible to support the things you care about, and easier to reach your goals. 
- Do our phones really listen to us? (I'm talking about toothpaste and the next day I get toothpaste ads)
	- If certain apps are open, and certain settings have not been turned off, then while those apps are open they will sometimes use voice data.  Most apps do not listen over your microphone though.
	- However, searches that you make on your phone surrounding the topic will surely cause this to happen.  This happened recently to me when I got a cat.
- Can you elaborate more on how today's data might impact your job prospects, insurance rates, and credit scores?
	- Hiring people, the idea of insurance, and the idea of credit all involve a game of risk based on people.  If you have more data about people, then you can play that game a lot better and be more profitable.  There are laws around this to a degree, but there are a lot of slippery slopes that can evolve into this over time.  They shouldn't affect those things currently, but they surely could in the long-term future.
- What is the dark web, really?
	- The dark web is not something most people have to worry about.  If the internet were a city, then this is the underground criminal part of that city.  To get there, you have to know where the entrances are and how to safely move about once you're there.  In reality, the dark web is a place anyone can get to by using certain tools and "protocols."  One of these is the "tor" (T-O-R) protocol, which makes it easier to be anonymous on the internet and even host websites that can't easily be traced to a single place.  Due to the secrecy and ability to hide yourself, these Tor networks are used to conduct criminal business.  This is what people are talking about when they say dark web.  Security researchers, the FBI, and many other organizations crawl around the dark web to gather intel about the bad guys.  Unless you know what you're doing though, do not go on there.
- DeepSink – the new OpenAI GPT offering that hit the news this week. I’m tempted to try it, but before I do that, what should I think about or be wary of, or how do I best protect my privacy?
	- 
- Please explain further how my values can be exploited through data. Isn’t it a good thing for businesses to understand my values and the general population? Providing money to businesses that share my values is a good thing to me. Or is there more a manipulative side to this that I am not understanding? 
	- To exploit means to use for one's benefit.  The question is whether that exploitation or simply the use of your data is a use that aligns with your values.  
	- If that business is "good."  However, good is quite subjective to what those values are.  If the business aligns with the broader and even more narrow interests like your own, then it could be an awesome way to use data.  

## Data Privacy and Business

- How does the business ensure that we are complying with data privacy regulations?
	- We check up on the legislation and regulation that is coming into play.
	- A great resource is the IAPP
- Do I need to think about cookies different as a consumer versus when I am at work?
