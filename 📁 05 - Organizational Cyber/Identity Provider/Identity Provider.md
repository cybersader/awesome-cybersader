**You:**

What do most people use "Authentik" for with networking?

**ChatGPT:**

**Authentik** is a versatile open-source identity provider often used in networking and IT environments to manage authentication and authorization. Here are the most common use cases for **Authentik** in networking:

### 1. **Centralized Authentication and Authorization**

- **Authentik** acts as an identity provider (IdP), enabling single sign-on (SSO) for various applications and services across the network.
- It supports modern protocols like **OIDC**, **SAML**, and **LDAP**, making it compatible with a wide range of services.
- This allows network administrators to centralize user management, reducing the need for multiple credentials across systems.

### 2. **Integrating with Reverse Proxies**

- **Authentik** is often used alongside reverse proxies like **NGINX** or **Traefik** to enforce authentication and authorization for internal or external web services.
- It adds an authentication layer for services that do not natively support modern identity protocols, securing access to sensitive applications.

### 3. **Zero Trust Networking**

- In a Zero Trust architecture, **Authentik** helps enforce strict identity verification policies for users and devices before granting access to network resources.
- It integrates with tools like VPNs or Software-Defined Perimeters (SDPs) to verify user credentials dynamically.

### 4. **Self-Hosted Identity Management**

- For organizations that want to maintain control over their identity management infrastructure, **Authentik** provides a self-hosted alternative to cloud services like **Okta**, **Auth0**, or **Azure AD**.
- This is particularly useful for privacy-conscious organizations or those with compliance requirements that mandate on-premises solutions.

### 5. **Network Access Control**

- **Authentik** integrates with **LDAP** or Active Directory to authenticate users for network access.
- It can act as a RADIUS front-end to manage Wi-Fi or VPN access securely.

### 6. **OAuth2 / API Access Management**

- For environments that use microservices or APIs, **Authentik** provides OAuth2 support to secure API endpoints.
- It ensures that only authorized users or applications can interact with sensitive network components.

### 7. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

- **Authentik** supports MFA, adding an additional layer of security for accessing network services.
- It can enforce MFA policies for both internal and external users.

### 8. **Monitoring and Auditing Access**

- With built-in audit logging and detailed activity reports, **Authentik** provides visibility into authentication events across the network.
- This is valuable for compliance, security monitoring, and forensic analysis.

### Examples of Use in Networking Scenarios:

- Securing web applications hosted internally.
- Adding authentication to Docker or Kubernetes dashboards.
- Protecting NAS systems like **TrueNAS** or **Unraid** with a user-friendly identity provider.
- Managing remote access for employees via secure VPN gateways.

By integrating **Authentik** into networking workflows, organizations can enhance security, streamline user management, and ensure compatibility with modern authentication standards.
