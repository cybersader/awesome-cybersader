# Messaging Platform for Teams

- Signal

# Setting Up Signal for OOB Comms

- Have someone who anticipates being there the longest start the group message on Signal
- For accounts, make a username and share that or share your numbers to get everyone into the group
- For "group settings" for the chat:
	- Disappearing message: Off
	- Sounds and notifications: 
		- Use custom notifications
		- Set it to something alarming if the messaging will strictly be for incident
		- Else: just use any normal notification tone
