There are a few things to think about when it comes to passwordless and really authentication factors with proving ones identity.  

We have convenience, whether that factor is safe in transit to the point of verification, and how they are stored along with the things that are needed to verify them, and how the responsible parties use these for verification.  For instance websites have to enable passkeys or passwords. 
  
Also we have to think about recovery and backup plans when it comes to these different methods of authentication. 

We also have the presenting of the actual authentication material or a cryptographic ally controlled process like with a challenge and response. 

You also have to account for the efforts or convenience of needing to change your authentication for each service or website in bulk.  This is a double-edged sword.  For instance manually changing a password for each service requires a second factor and usually an email or phone number and is a very involved process that is hard to ought to me by nature. 

You also have to account for the type of things that were stored along with the authentication material and the flexibility of such a storage.  A vault sort of speak.
