- What's going on with DOGE is extremely relevant to security and data integrity
- Slimmer government is real good, but we have to be careful how we slim it down
- Jake Williams said DOGE is a bigger threat to our information systems than Chinese threat actors
- Move fast and break things is terrible for security
- Some of the people in this org wouldn't pass a normal background check, so it's dangerous to give them country super-admin without the right process
- It's good to cut down the bureacracy, but we can't subvert national security to do it.  It has to be done right or it can do a ton of damage
- Another word for red tape is "controls".
- If you don't know why a control is there:
    - Do the "5 Whys" and you typically get to the bottom.
- There's no way DOGE is asking enough questions
- The ultimate secrecy authority is the president and they can get clearance from him, but it's risky to do this when we can't tell what controls ensure security here
- Many organizations structure access by roles.  If you start slashing roles, then that can break some technology too.
- We can't trust the integrity of data
- These investigations are being executed at high speed without regard for the security ramifications.  
- FOIA - freed of information act
    - There's a lot of information you don't want in an unclassed system
- You can't audit an open AI model because you have the tool and not how the tool was made.  Software is different from a utility piece of data just like how an exe doesn't show you the secret sauce.
- Why do we all use O365 mail?
