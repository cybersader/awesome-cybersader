TOTAL WORK IN PROGRESS HERE - just jotted down randomness for now

# Machines, Hardware

- Use the system that demands your attention least

# OS

- Use Linux where you can
- Use Android for mobile if possible - can mimic the UI of iOS
- MAC and Windows are probably your daily drivers for personal computing

# Media

- Subscriptions aren't bad - means you know, depending on some research/investigation and reading their policies, what you are actually supporting

# Politics 

- Our voting system causes a devolvement into bipartisan groups - [(2) Why Democracy Is Mathematically Impossible - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7ws2DF-zk) 
- Stand on business/principles
- Simple...strive for truth, but be pedagogical and patient - straw man

>"For when one says, 'I follow Paul,' and another, 'I follow Apollos,' are you not mere human beings? What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe‚Äîas the Lord has assigned to each his task. I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow."

# Identity - Authentication and Authorization

- Be careful of where you put your identity
- With your identity, entities can utilize the information to their own ends - a result partly possible because of modern computing
- Use aliasing for the types of identity verification that these entities requires.  This is especially true for those entities which have interests not aligned to your own
	- Modern examples of this:
		- Email aliasing
- Data minimization
	- Minimizing data in forms
	- Configuring settings to minimize data usage for the entity's interest - especially true in countries where laws make this easier (EU with GDPR)
- Authentication factor management
	- Be smart about how you handle passwords and usernames
	- Use Bitwarden or KeypassXC

# Media 

- Use "unbiased" sources? - yeah...that's a dilemma
- Avoid "free" websites or minimize data and maximize privacy on them to demotivate unethical/immoral means to monetization
- Use [Sub-Based & Ad-Avoiding Media Platforms](../../üï∏Ô∏è%20UNSTRUCTURED/Sub-Based%20&%20Ad-Avoiding%20Media%20Platforms.md)

# Social Engineering

- . 

# Persuasive Technology & Internet Resilience

- Set timers on technology
- Have a discipline, DAILY, that doesn't involve technology at all like working out or riding bikes or reading
- Spiritual life and catechesis
- ConvenantEyes on every device
- Family settings on devices with internet
- Go for agent-based so roaming can work
