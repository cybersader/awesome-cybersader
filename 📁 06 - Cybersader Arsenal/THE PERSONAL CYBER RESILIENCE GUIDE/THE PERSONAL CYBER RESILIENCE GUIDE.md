TOTAL WORK IN PROGRESS HERE - just jotted down randomness for now

- Buy from a place like microcenter
- Learn to build a PC and fix them.  Saves you money in the long run

# OS

- Use Linux where you can
- Use Android for mobile if possible - can mimic the UI of iOS
- MAC and Windows are probably your daily drivers for personal computing

# Software

- Learn to use open source software where you can except when something needs managed or to essentially run on a computer somewhere else

# Cloud Backups

- Have one of your tech friends set up a NAS at home and back up there
- Backup to something like Storj, AWS, etc.

# Messaging

- Get on a platform like Signal that's more private

# Knowledge Management

- Use a combination of Notion, Obsidian, and a versioned storage repository as a SSOT

# Mobile Security

- Use a biometric login and backup with something else that's more secure and stored in password manager

# Groceries

- Get an app for groceries
- Minimize your data and what not by configuring the app towards privacy
- Save all your groceries in there and both spouses should download it - helps reduce friction with handling groceries together

# Local Backups

# Media Storage

- Get a home NAS

# Home Network Security

# Media

- Subscriptions aren't bad - means you know, depending on some research/investigation and reading their policies, what you are actually supporting

# Politics 

- Our voting system causes a devolvement into bipartisan groups - [(2) Why Democracy Is Mathematically Impossible - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7ws2DF-zk) 
- Stand on business/principles
- Simple...strive for truth, but be pedagogical and patient - don't straw man but instead steel man

>"For when one says, 'I follow Paul,' and another, 'I follow Apollos,' are you not mere human beings? What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe‚Äîas the Lord has assigned to each his task. I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow."

# Identity - Authentication and Authorization

- Be careful of where you put your identity
- With your identity, entities can utilize the information to their own ends - a result partly possible because of modern computing
- Use aliasing for the types of identity verification that these entities requires.  This is especially true for those entities which have interests not aligned to your own
	- Modern examples of this:
		- Email aliasing
- Data minimization
	- Minimizing data in forms
	- Configuring settings to minimize data usage for the entity's interest - especially true in countries where laws make this easier (EU with GDPR)
- Authentication factor management
	- Be smart about how you handle passwords and usernames
	- Use Bitwarden or KeypassXC

# Media 

- Use "unbiased" sources? - yeah...that's a dilemma
- Avoid "free" websites or minimize data and maximize privacy on them to demotivate unethical/immoral means to monetization
- Use [Sub-Based & Ad-Avoiding Media Platforms](../../üï∏Ô∏è%20UNSTRUCTURED/Sub-Based%20&%20Ad-Avoiding%20Media%20Platforms.md)
