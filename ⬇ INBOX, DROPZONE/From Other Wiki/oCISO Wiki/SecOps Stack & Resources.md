# SecOps Team Productivity
## Windows Desktop Tools
- [Microsoft PowerToys | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) 
- [Sysinternals - Sysinternals | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/) 
- [ShareX - The best free and open source screenshot tool for Windows](https://getsharex.com/)
## Internal AI Chat
- Upload files, SOPs, and documents that you can ask questions about
	- [StanGirard/quivr: Your GenAI Second Brain üß† A personal productivity assistant (RAG) ‚ö°Ô∏èü§ñ Chat with your docs (PDF, CSV, ...) & apps using Langchain, GPT 3.5 / 4 turbo, Private, Anthropic, VertexAI, Ollama, LLMs, that you can share with users ! Local & Private alternative to OpenAI GPTs & ChatGPT powered by retrieval-augmented generation.](https://github.com/StanGirard/quivr) - can be self-hosted for privacy and security concerns, encourages learning about internal PPTs (people, process, tech)
- [Khoj: An Open-Source AI Copilot for your Second Brain](https://khoj.dev/) - utilizes various sources (GitHub, Obsidian, Notion, PDFs, files.)  Use any AI with it or self-host it too.

## Team Wiki System
A team wiki system encourages collaboration and innovation.

- In a business, to make things easy always stick with plaintext and Markdown
- (FREE) Use [Logseq: A privacy-first, open-source knowledge base](https://logseq.com/) with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) 
    - I haven‚Äôt tried this, but from what I can tell, LogSeq is free, open source, and you just have to integrate it with something like Git
    - To make this work large scale so that wikis can be operated via GitHub and seen in GitHub, there are things that one MUST get right:
        - Find a way to easily use relative paths for images and internal links in the tool
        - Use markdown formatted links and not Wikilinks
	- Another plus is that it forces SecOps team to learn some DevOps
    - [Logseq sync with Git and GitHub ‚Äì Logseq Community Hub](https://hub.logseq.com/integrations/aV9AgETypcPcf8avYcHXQT/logseq-sync-with-git-and-github/krMyU6jSEN8jG2Yjvifu9i)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with the Git plugin is awesome, but it‚Äôs $4.2 per month (50 dollars a year) per user
    - Can have some security concerns (give and take) with community plugins. Just don‚Äôt trust them 100%
- If you don‚Äôt care about spending 8 dollars per month per user, then you can go with [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), but migration out of it is not easy
- Other Self-Hosted Options (on our own infra):
    - [AppFlowy](https://www.appflowy.io/)
        - Pros: A lot like Notion. Web-based. Self-hosted.
        - Cons: Not as many integrations as Notion
    - [CodiLIA](https://github.com/LiaScript/CodiLIA) - self hosted version of HackMD
    - [Outline](https://www.getoutline.com/pricing)
        - Pros: lots of features and integrations. Web-based. Collaborative. Price that can cover lots of users.
        - Cons: Might be hard to migrate to.
    - [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/)
        - Pros: Very extensive and flexible. Can use lots of formats. Tons of features. Can host in various setups. Full-blown wiki.
        - Cons: Takes awhile to setup and manage (Digital Ocean does have a 1-click option though.) Might have a very steep learning curve. Clunky.
