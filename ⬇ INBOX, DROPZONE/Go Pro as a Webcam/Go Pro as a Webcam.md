1. How the camera networks to the computer
	- You have to set firewall rules to get this to work correctly and you can't be on some types of VPNs
# Tools for Advanced Troubleshooting
- Windows Firewall
- TCPView
- Wireshark
	- Seems to use mDNS or other establishment protocols
	- Webcam uses its own interface
