[(7) Arc on Windows is here. Now what... - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfvkfnAQ3JQ)

- "There's so many different ways that a Windows app can crash"
- 1.0
- When on Windows 10? - soon - they started with Windows 11
- Lots of features don't have parity with Windows
- Arc has a prototype culture - they will be sizing down Mac version and sizing up Windows version

- What's up next
	- Better performance
	- AI features 

- Swift on Windows
	- Arc is the best Swift on Windows app yet
	- The next best app was a calculator

- When Android - they need some talented engineers first

- For this milestone, it's all about making a browser that browses for you
