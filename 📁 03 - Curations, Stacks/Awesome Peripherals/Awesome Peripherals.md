Person:

- Talk some more about stem and keycap compatibility

ChatGPT:

- Stem and keycap compatibility is an essential aspect of customizing a mechanical keyboard, as it determines whether a specific keycap set can be used with your chosen switches. The stem is the part of the switch that protrudes and connects to the keycap. There are a few key points to consider when evaluating stem and keycap compatibility:

I. MX-style stems A. Most common stem type B. Cross-shaped C. Compatible with a wide range of keycaps D. Used by many switch brands

1. Cherry MX
2. Gateron
3. Kailh
4. ZealPC
5. Outemu
6. TTC
7. NovelKeys (Cream, Blueberry, etc.) E. Majority of custom and aftermarket keycaps are made for MX-style stems

II. Topre stems A. Unique stem type found in Topre switches B. Circular shape with two small tabs on the sides C. Limited keycap compatibility compared to MX-style stems D. Some aftermarket keycap sets are made for Topre stems, but options are fewer E. Topre to MX sliders/adapters are available to increase keycap compatibility

1. Replace the stock Topre stems with MX-compatible sliders
2. Allows for using MX-style keycaps on Topre switches

III. ALPS/Matias stems A. Less common stem type B. Rectangular shape C. Used in ALPS and Matias switches D. Limited keycap compatibility compared to MX-style stems E. Some keycap sets are available for ALPS/Matias stems, but options are limited

IV. Keycap compatibility factors A. Stem compatibility is the primary concern B. Keycap sizes and layout support

1. Ensure the keycap set includes necessary sizes for your specific keyboard layout
2. Some keycap sets come with extra keys for non-standard layouts C. Keycap material and profile
3. Different materials (ABS, PBT, etc.) and profiles (OEM, Cherry, SA, etc.) affect typing experience and aesthetics
4. Choose keycaps that match your preferences

When choosing keycaps for your mechanical keyboard, it's crucial to consider the stem type of your switches and the compatibility with the desired keycap set. MX-style stems offer the most extensive range of keycap options, while Topre and ALPS/Matias stems have more limited choices. Ensure that the keycap set you select is compatible with your switches and supports your specific keyboard layout.

Person:

- Explain the different keycap profiles and caveats to that. Are there different sized keycaps. How do i buy different keycap seta and ensure there wont he uneveness due to mixing sets or not having the correct layout?

ChatGPT:

- Keycap profiles refer to the shape, height, and contour of keycaps, which can significantly impact the typing experience and aesthetics of your mechanical keyboard. Here's a summary of common keycap profiles and their characteristics:

I. Keycap Profiles A. OEM

1. Common on most pre-built keyboards
2. Sculpted (different heights for each row)
3. Medium height

```
B. Cherry
    1. Similar to OEM but slightly shorter
    2. Sculpted profile
    3. Lower height for a more comfortable typing experience

C. SA (Spherical All)
    1. High profile, spherical top
    2. Can be sculpted or uniform
    3. Vintage aesthetic and feel

D. DSA (Deep Dish Spherical All)
    1. Low profile, spherical top
    2. Uniform height
    3. Easier to adapt to different keyboard layouts

E. XDA
    1. Flat profile with a larger surface area
    2. Uniform height
    3. Comfortable typing experience due to the large surface area

F. MDA
    1. Mix of sculpted and uniform design
    2. Semi-spherical top
    3. Ergonomic typing experience

```

II. Keycap Sizes and Layout Considerations A. Standard keycap sizes for most layouts

1. ANSI (American National Standards Institute)
2. ISO (International Organization for Standardization) B. Non-standard keycap sizes
3. 1u, 1.25u, 1.5u, 1.75u, 2u, etc. (refers to keycap width)
4. Commonly found on custom or non-standard layouts (e.g., split keyboards, 65%, 75%, etc.) C. Spacebar sizes
5. Usually 6.25u or 7u, but other sizes may be used in custom layouts

III. Ensuring Compatibility and Uniformity When Buying Keycap Sets A. Check keycap compatibility

1. Ensure the keycap set is compatible with your switch stems (MX, Topre, ALPS, etc.) B. Assess keycap sizes and layout support
2. Make sure the keycap set includes the necessary keycap sizes for your specific keyboard layout
3. Look for extra keys included in the set for non-standard layouts or custom keyboards C. Mixing keycap sets
4. It is generally not recommended to mix keycap sets, especially those with different profiles, as it may result in unevenness and an inconsistent typing experience
5. If you must mix sets, try to use keycaps with the same profile and material D. Read product descriptions and consult compatibility charts
6. Most keycap set manufacturers provide compatibility charts and detailed descriptions of included keycaps

When purchasing a keycap set, pay attention to the keycap sizes, layout support, and compatibility with your switches. To avoid unevenness and maintain a consistent typing experience, try to use keycaps from the same set or at least with the same profile and material. Always read product descriptions and consult compatibility charts to ensure you're getting the correct keycaps for your keyboard layout.

Person:
