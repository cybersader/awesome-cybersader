# URL to Link Collection Curation

## Curated Solutions

- Webflow template to Netlify
- Start[.]me - simple bookmark page you could use
- Publish a Notion page - reuse Notion and simply publish a page with links to things
- LinkAce - another bookmark tool I haven’t looked at
- Hypage - Linktree alternative
- Any html, css, and JS template → Netlify hosting (turns all the files into a website with a link for free)
- “Pastebins”
- Glitch remixes
