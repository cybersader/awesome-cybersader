I don't hate small talk.  In fact, I believe there is "utility" to it.  However, there's types of small talk that I dislike.  My conversations with people are not constantly evaluated for whether they bring me value or not, but I like to talk genuinely and in a way that brings about more understanding or, simply put, more fruits.

Here's an illustration of the sort of conversation that I don't like to capitalize on:

**Person**: "Have you watched that show yet? It was so good"
**Me**: "Yeah. It was pretty good" (my head: I liked the jokes and what not, but the storytelling and premise of the movie wasn't my favorite) 
**Person**: "I really liked it.  It was hilarious."

> [!info] sometimes I'll share genuine opinion if it's not "scandalous" or misleading of my character.

By itself, this conversation is just fine. It sparks additional conversation and a sharing of understanding. However, my issue with this sort of small talk is when it pollutes conversations of more valuable discussion or becomes too regular - especially if it's with those you are close with.

Small talk comes from a good place, but when it happens all the time, it can seem like people are always looking for the next big thing or trying too hard to always have something to agree on or something new to bring to the conversation.  In cybersecurity and IT, there's always a new thing, and it gets tiring to constantly hear about the "next-gen" tech that's coming out.  As much as I love curating, I don't want to just consume. I think more time should be spent arguing, contemplating, innovating, and "marinating" ðŸ˜†.

The objective of communication should be true understanding through authentic reflection rather than a constant sharing of reactions.  

This comes from a desire to know others in a deeper way.  Often, these reactions of "have you seen that show", "do you know that guy", and similar talk are fine, but not when they become too regular with interactions.  One could say I desire the friction in conversations because that's what forges sharper and stronger individuals. I don't want to only know what we agree on, what places we eat, or the basic stuff. I want to share bold ideas and not be afraid to be disagreed with. A lot of the times, I'll be wrong, but it's hard to know that if we aren't used to openly discussing with all sorts of people we aren't close to.
