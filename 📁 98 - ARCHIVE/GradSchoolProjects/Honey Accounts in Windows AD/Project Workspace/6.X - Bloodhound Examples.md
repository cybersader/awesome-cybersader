This is stand in for not having been able to complete Bloodhound stuff.

SharpHound Data Collector - collects datasets for Bloodhound to storein Neo4j then use to find relationships

# Data collection Files
Several files have been created on the workstation at this point. Most of these could be considered an indicator of compromise in some regard.

- **recon.txt** - the output includes a series of commands considered probable compromise. whoami, net group "domain admins" /domain, DNS cache, local share enumeration, et cetera... all indicate someone or somebot interacting with a system.
- **the long stringed BIN file**: an archive of BloodHound/SharpHound execution.
- **master.zip** (unfortunate naming), but regardless, an artifact of GitHub code repo downloads
- **two zip files named BloodHound** - even if the execution gets by AV/EDR, fine, catch the file name with Sysmon EID 11 file creation events that match defined patterns

Cypher Queries:
- cypher queries can be used to return nodes based on relationships and various AD attributes

**List all GPOs Cypher**:
```
Match (n:GPO) return n
```

Match (n:Group) WHERE n.name CONTAINS "ADMIN" return n
```
