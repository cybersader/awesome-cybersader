	- In this paper, we revisit the security impact of typo-tolerant password authentication. We observe that the existing security analysis of such systems considers only password spraying attacks.

	- Credential-guessing attacks often exploit passwords that were reused across a user's online accounts. To learn how organizations can better protect users, we retrospectively analyzed our university's vulnerability to credential-guessing attacks across twenty years. Given a list of university usernames, we searched for matches in both data breaches from hundreds of websites and a dozen large compilations of breaches. After cracking hashed passwords and tweaking guesses, we successfully guessed passwords for 32.0% of accounts matched to a university email address in a data breach, as well as 6.5% of accounts where the username (but not necessarily the domain) matched. Many of these accounts remained vulnerable for years after the breached data was leaked, and passwords found verbatim in breaches were nearly four times as likely to have been exploited (i.e., suspicious account activity was observed) than tweaked guesses. Over 70 different data breaches and various username-matching strategies bootstrapped correct guesses. In surveys of 40 users whose passwords we guessed, many users were unaware of the risks to their university account or that their credentials had been breached. This analysis of password reuse at our university provides pragmatic advice for organizations to protect accounts.

	- The user and entity behavioural analytics (UEBA) may reveal the origins of data breaches in addition to reporting illegal or malicious actions undertaken by employees.  However, it has a dilemma just like with entity resolution

	- By exploiting vulnerability V1 listed in section 3.2, the attacker can gain access to a developer’s credential in the GitHub repo at DS-1 and to embed malware into the code. Some techniques to "steal" credentials are through spearphishing email, password-spraying, brute force, scraping published credentials in repositories

	- “Beyond that, organisations need to consider the use of user entity behaviour analytics (UEBA), which will allow them to see if a legitimate user profile is behaving in a suspicious way and investigate potential compromise quicker,” says Ben Freeney at Fujitsu.

	- User and Entity Behavior Analysis (UEBA): creates models of normal behavior for individual users or components such as IP addresses, servers, and applications using statistical analysis or learning methods to detect deviations from the normal state. According to the Gartner analysis, machine learning methods (supervised/unsupervised ML) are increasingly used in addition to rulebased and statistical approaches for UEBA. For example, machine learning approaches select metrics for individual event data fields (e.g., authentication processes, activities in applications), whose temporal development and correlation are considered. Such techniques are used in several products including IBM QRadar UBA App, Exabeam SIEM, LogRhythm UEBA, ArcSight UBA, DarkTrace Enterprise. According to UEBA methods are crucial for Security Operation Centers (SOC). They produce fewer alarms when compare to event-based analysis. This is particularly important for SMEs where the number of SOC personnel is extremely small or even outsourced (therefore, fewer alarm rate results in reducing SOC costs for SMEs). Detailed information about UEBA and their importance can be found in.
